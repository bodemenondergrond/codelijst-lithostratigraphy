The lower boundary is easily distinguished from either the underlying Merelbeke Member, the Egem Sandstone Bed or the Egem Member. The often reported gradual transition between Pittem Member and the overlying Vlierzele unit in boreholes, is erroneous and due to a confusion between the Pittem Member and clayey parts of the Vlierzele unit sensu Fobe (1995) (Fobe, 1995 p 143). Also, in typical cases, the limit between the clayey sediment of the Pittem Member and the overlying Vlierzele Sand can be traced with reasonable confidence in the geophysical log correlation profiles by Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009).

The presence of silt and sand is distributed in layers of cm to dm. Several subunits can be distinguished as proposed by Jacobs et al. (1996a, b) and Steurbaut (1998). The Kortemark Member occurs between heavy clay units: the Aalbeke Member below and the Egemkapel Member above. The maximal thickness is about 25 m (Geets et al., 2000). In the top of the underlying Aalbeke Member a gradual coarsening upwards occurs, ended by a sharp coarsening that marks the start of coarser sediments in the Kortemark Member (see analyses from Geets (1991) and interpreted in Steurbaut (1998)). In geophysical log patterns the start of the coarsening upwards interval in the Aalbeke Mbr above its very clay?rich main part, as well as the sharp coarse shift at the top of the coarsening upwards part of the Aalbeke Mbr which marks the position of a fine sand layer, can be observed fairly consistently (e.g. Torhout 052E0195, Tielt 053E0061, Gent 55W1020, On?Kallo 1 014E0355). The formal boundary between the Aalbeke and Kortemark Members is drawn at the position of the major grain?size shift and the income of the first fine?sand layer (correlation profiles in Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire, 2009). This boundary definition at the base of the lowest fine?sand layer has the advantage to correspond to an observable horizon with water outflow in the upper part of the Desimpel clay pit in Kortemark (Steurbaut, 1998, Fig.5). Detailed lithological analyses of the Kortemark Member sections in the Tielt borehole 068E0169 and the Kortemark and Egem extraction pits, are figured in Geets (1991) and Steurbaut (1998, p 117). Details in the geophysical well log signature in the Kortemark Member can be correlated between wells, especially the significant higher values of the resistivity, standing for more sandy layers, can be correlated between the different logs.",Tielt Formation,,"Steurbaut (1998) has proposed the level of about 71m below surface in the Tielt borehole (068E0169); map sheet 21/6 x=76.439; y=187.576; z=48) for the lower boundary with the underlying Aalbeke Member. However, in?the-present?text the base of Kortemark has been replaced at a level in the Kortemark Desimpel quarry corresponding to the level at 48 m depth in the Tielt borehole according to the log interpretation Tielt 053E0061 in the compendium. Indeed because the top of the Aalbeke Member gradually becomes siltier upwards (see analyses in Steurbaut, 1998 fig. 5) it has been argued in?the?present?synthesis that the first marked sandy layer in the Desimpel clay pit in Kortemark (marked as  sharp junction waterflow at the base of subunit C in Steurbaut 1998 p 117) (map sheet 20/3?4 Kortemark?Torhout, x= 57.050,y= 190.400, z= +16m) is a more easily recognisable lithostratigraphical horizon to mark the base of the Kortemark Member. In the present review this level is chosen as the formal boundary between the Aalbeke and Kortemark Members (see discussion in Description above).

(2020) to be characterised as a complex of facies deposited in trough-shaped structures with intensely bioturbated foresets and remnants of bryozoan reefs in the lower part. The sediment consists of heterogenous glauconiferous fine-grained sand with a much lower number of fines (less than 125µm 15%), a larger amount of coarse grains (>250 µm 21–33%) and glauconite (39–49%) than that of the underlying Borsbeek Member. The color ranges from bluish-green to whitish-grey, depending on the amount of carbonate particles originating from the abrasion of the remains of the inhabitants of the bryozoan reefs that are incorporated in the sediment. Locally, the sediment is very fossiliferous, especially in the lower part. The macrofauna is generally small-sized, with bryozoans, serpulids (e.g. Ditrupa), decapod and cirripede crustaceans, bivalves and gastropods, echinoids and brachiopods. Terebratulids are locally abundant in the lower part and can be found both loose in the sediment as well as encased in sandstone. These terebratulids can also be encrusted by bryozoans. The brachiopod Cryptopora nysti is locally abundant. Shell fragments of lingulid brachiopods (Glottidia dumortieri) occur throughout. Trace fossils Macaronichnus segregatis, M. s. degiberti and Scolicia occur abundantly, and allow to ascribe the member to the Cruziana ichnofacies. Yellowish- to orange-colored clayey-limestone concretions and light-colored calcareous sandstone with bryozoans, terebratulids and small-sized mollusks in mold preservation are locally abundant above the basal gravel. The basal gravel generally contains small quartz and flint pebbles, reworked elasmobranch teeth, fish bones and fragments of marine mammal bones, and sometimes also larger sized concretions and bones that are reworked from the Borsbeek Member.",Diest Formation,"The Deurne Member has a fairly limited thickness; in many of the documented sites it has a thickness well below 1 m. Locally, when it scours deep into the underlying Borsbeek Member, it may reach up to more than 5.5 m.

However palynology reported from the Bocholt borehole by Van der Sluys (2000, 2.1.5) compares the pollen in the upper Brunssum I bed  with the early Pleistocene clays of the Weelde Formation in Belgium and the Tegelen Member in the Netherlands.

In between occurs the Pey Bed. The borehole is cored, sedimentological and mineralogical analyses are available as well as geophysical well logs and also palynological investigations are reported (Van der Sluys, 2000).

In the type area it could be observed in temporary and partial outcrops along the TGV line (Hennebert & Doremus, 1997a, b). It consists, from top to bottom of:
– white chalky marl, with grey silicified concretions;
– grey-white marl with greenish shine, with fine glauconite.
In the area transitional to the Mons basin (Péruwelz, Hennebert, 1999a, b) the member is not subdivided in successive units but consists of grey marls to grey-white marly chalk with dull partly silicified concretions (“chailles”), better corresponding to the original definition as “Fortes Toises”. In the parastratotype area of the Flemish region observations are based on cores and geophysical well logs, allowing a less detailed but more consistent description. Cuttings (95W0153) consist of bright green silty marl in the upper part, mixed with fine glauconitic sand in the lower part. The core consists from top to bottom of light greenish chalk with oxidised specks of iron sulfide, turning into green silty chalk with clay laminations containing shell debris, with a basal layer of white very coarse-grained and porous chalk. The gamma-ray log allows to recognize two sequences in the Merlin Member, delineated by beds which show an increase of the gamma ray readings; these probably correspond to the more sandy glauconiferous base of a fining upwards sequence, grading into white chalks. Overall a steady increase in gamma ray level is observed from top to bottom of the Vert Galand Formation. Although the stratigraphic succession observed in boreholes in the Flemish region may be deposited in a more distal part of the sedimentary basin compared to the Tournaisis and does not show the silicifications (which are observed at a higher level and included in the overlying stratigraphic unit) it seems to confirm the subdivision in two units in the type area.",Vert Galand Formation,"In the type area from 5 to 10 m.

The clay content is 2.5 ± 1.3% and the D90 of the grain size distribution of 404 ± 108 μm, making the Kiel Member less clayey and with a larger coarse fraction compared to the underlying Edegem Member and overlying Antwerpen Member (De Meuter & Laga, 1976; Verhaegen, 2020). This facies occurs in the south and central part of the city of Antwerp (De Meuter & Laga, 1976). To the north and east of Antwerp this member becomes fossiliferous (Everaert et al., 2020). Everaert et al. (2020) studied several temporary outcrops of the Kiel Member in Antwerp and could distinguish the fossiliferous Kiel and Antwerpen members by a slight but marked color difference (greyish versus blackish) due to a somewhat lower clay and glauconite content and a coarser sand fraction in the Kiel Member. The glauconite content ranges from 28% to 54% and is on average 38% (Adriaens, 2015). The Kiel Member is characterized by a different ichnofacies, with the almost continuous presence of bioturbation. Everaert et al. (2020) described furthermore in great detail sandstone layers and shell layers (Glycymeris, Cordiopsis, Cyrtodaria), intercalated between several metres of loose grey sand, seemingly devoid of calcareous fossils.

The mineralogical and clay mineralogical composition of the clayey-top-facies is very specific and differs from the rest of the Diest Formation. The clay mineralogy consists of a significant amount of expandable clay minerals: dioctahedral smectite but also, and more distinctly, trioctahedral Fe-rich vermiculite (see Adriaens & Vandenberghe, 2020 for details). This type of vermiculite is rare in the stratigraphic column, and is assumed to be related to a glauconitic soil environment. Most likely, it was not formed in-situ but originates from a remote source area where a soil developed on glauconitic sediment in very specific, yet poorly understood, conditions.
Apart from the distinct vermiculite, the clayey-top-facies is also relatively enriched in siderite, apatite and sporadically vivianite and chlorite but the relatively high clay content and the presence of Fe-vermiculite are the distinctive criteria for the clayey-top-facies.

They concluded that in the RVG the presently defined Waubach Member is probably a time equivalent facies  of the clayey part of the Kasterlee Formation and of the overlying Retie Member of the Mol Formation ( see LIS Mol Formation). This Retie Member is the now formalised ‘lower Mol’ or ‘Kasterlee-sensu-Gulinck’ lithostratigraphic unit described in the Neogene-2020 volume. The Retie Member is for lithological reasons ranked in the Mol Formation. The Waubach Member probably correlates with the Hauptkies in the Lower Rhine area however , detailed correlations between both areas remain hypothetical.","As it became clear that the originally described Waubach sand and gravel in the Belgian part of the Roer Valley Graben (RVG) as in Vandenberghe et al. (2005, fig.10) could be systematically split up in 2 parts based on geophysical logs signals (Vandenberghe et al. 2020 fig. 6), the terms Lower and Upper Waubach Member were used (Louwye & Vandenberghe, 2020, fig. 3); since it became clear that the lower part of Waubach sand and gravel could be identified as the Inden Formation, the name Waubach Member is now reserved for its former upper part, but without the prefix upper.  It is not clear how the upper and lower Waubach terms used  above the Inden Formation in the scheme by  Wong et al. (2007) in the adjacent Dutch RVG (Figure 40 1) correspond to parts of the Waubach Sand as described above. Probably the clay shown at the contact between the two parts on the scheme is related to the clay horizon labelled Ki-k-4 and underlain by a sand unit Ki-z-5 by Dusar et al. (2014) Ki-k-4 and Ki-z-5 are absent in the Belgian part of the RVG . The Waubach Sand Member present in the Belgian RVG is labelled Ki-z-4 by Dusar et al.

National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium. http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/Boom-Formation",05/04/2024,"An extensive synthesis on the Boom Clay geology is given in Vandenberghe et al. (2014). The Boom Clay is a grey silty clay or clayey silt with fairly constant chemical and mineralogical properties. Macroscopic fossil content is limited and mostly single shells of the mollusc Portlandia deshayesiana (in the literature also reported as Nuculana and Leda) are observed.. The ecological analysis of all observed fauna and flora in the clay proves the marine character of the clay deposit. The Boom Clay has been deposited in an open shelf sea under warm climatic conditions as a life-supporting mud at an approximate depth of about 100 m for the most clay-enriched parts, although the water depth fluctuated with several tens of meters due to eustatic variations during the full history of the clay sedimentation. The most silty horizons contain glauconite pellets. The clay contains a few percent of very early diagenetic, mm to cm and even dm scale concretionary pyrite that formed clearly associated with the presence of organic matter in the clay. Black staining of the clay is due to the presence of an increased amount of fine particles of land-derived plant remains. Small quantities of marine organic matter adsorbed on the clay minerals are always present. Marl horizons occur and typically large septaria concretions have developed in the most calcareous horizons. The septaria are an iconic property of the Boom Clay Formation (Septarienton in Germany). Detailed clay mineralogy of the Boom Clay can be found in Zeelmaekers et al. (2015).",Rupel Group,"In the Campine subsurface, the maximal thickness of the Boom Clay Formation is about 100 to 120 m, but the formation thickness is reduced where its top is either eroded or where it is replaced by the Eigenbilzen Formation and/or the Bilzen Formation pro parte (Figure 5): e.g. a few meter thickness in the southern part of the Waasland area, 40 m in Rupel area, 40 m in the Hasselt area, 80 m in the Antwerp area and about 10 m in the Albert-Canal section near Eigenbilzen.","The area in which the Boom Clay Formation traditionally has been and still is exploited for brick making or other structural clay products, along the Rupel river between Rumst and Boom (Rupel Cuesta) and along the Scheldt between Temse and Antwerpen, is designated as the type area of the Boom Clay ( Figure 1a). Instead of the former numerous brick yards with their own clay extraction pits, nowadays only two actively exploited large pits are active: the Wienerberger clay pit at Rumst and the Argex clay pit at Kruibeke-Burcht. Both clay pits are therefore the practical type sections at present. Many sections of former clay pits in the type area are documented in Vandenberghe (1978) and the cored and geophysical borehole at Reet (water tower) documents the Rupel cuesta section (Van Echelpoel, 1991 fig. 4.5; Vandenberghe et al., 2001 fig. 3).
As the upper part of the Boom Clay Formation is considerably eroded in the designated type area (Figures 4 and 5), a group of additional boreholes around Mol-Dessel in the Antwerp Campine (Mol SCK 15, ON-Mol-1 and ON-Dessel-1), is selected as reference boreholes to demonstrate the complete Boom Clay Formation section (Figures 2 and 12). The geophysical well logs of the three boreholes presented in Figure 2 are interpreted in terms of the 4 members of the Boom Clay Formation and a few key horizons. The link of the geophysical logs to the lithology section of the boreholes is easy as the same interpretation terms are figured on the lithology section of the same Mol-Dessel area in Figure 12 which is representing the most complete information extracted from cores and geophysical logging including core imaging. A correlation between the Reet borehole section in the outcrop area and the equivalent part in the Mol-Dessel area is shown in Figure 11.",https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/boom-formation/

In the Hainaut area thickness is between 10?16m whilst in central Flanders and north Belgium thickness can be over 40 m. Towards the east in Brabant its thickness is reduced to a few meters. Originally the name was introduced by Gosselet (1874, p 611) to indicate the compact and stiff clays at the base of what is now known as the Ieper Group sediments; later, as a refinement of the lithostratigraphy, the sandy and silty Mont?Héribu Member at its base was individualised as a separate unit and the name Orchies Member was reserved for the compact heavy clays above the Mont?Héribu Member (Steurbaut, 1998). The later introduced name Saint?Maur Member (Belgian stratotype area, Geets, 1988; Maréchal, 1993), used in the legend of the 1:50 000 mapping in Flanders is a synonym of the Orchies Member although it (Saint?Maur unit) was generally used in a more restrictive way, because the lower part of the Orchies Member was erroneously assigned to the Mont Héribu Member; it is preferred to maintain the original name Orchies, a small locality to the southeast of Roubaix in Northern France. On maps 1:25 000 of the Brabant Wallon (Nivelles?Genappe, Braine?le?Comte?Féluy) the Formation de Carnières is used for a unit close to Orchies. On the legend of the geological maps 1:40 000 the Orchies Member was included in the Yc clayey deposits and in the stratigraphic register (1929,1932) in the Y1a. The argilite de Morlanwelz is a lateral equivalent of the Orchies Member (Steurbaut, 1991). The Wardrecques and Bailleul members are reported in King (1991). The lower part of the Wardrecques member belongs to the Orchies Member whilst the upper part and the Bailleul member corresponds to the Roubaix Member (King, 1991). This subdivision is not commonly used in the literature but the position of Wardrecques and Bailleul members is well documented in boreholes of the Moeskroen?Kortrijk?Marke?Ooigem area by King (1991, fig. 11).

A pebble layer has been reported occasionally at its base (Ya on the 1:40 000 geological maps). Whereas in the visual description of macroscopic samples, even from cores, it is very hard to see any further lithological subdivision of the Orchies Member, the geophysical log signatures (see reference boreholes in compendium) do show a systematic variability interpreted as grain?size and mineralogical variations. The top of the very high gamma?ray section at the base of the Orchies Member, about 10 to 15 m thick, is a correlatable surface (see also further Geophysical logs and Subdivisions). It corresponds to the top of the mistakenly named Mont?Héribu Member (KoMh) unit in the correlation figures in Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009 figs 12,14,16,18, 20, 22, 24) and approximately to the level 1 in the plates in Vandenberghe et al. 1991).

The central grain size value (mode or median) is finer than 150-175 ?m. The Member contains a subdominant admixture (much less than 2%) of very fine, light green glauconite pellets. In its original appearance (i.e., not decalcified), the sand is white to pale yellow, the carbonate content is higher than 15% and consists of fine mud. Carbonate content may locally reach high values, even exceeding 50%. The sand is fully or partially bioturbated and may contain very fine to cm-scale marly mud laminae. Macrofossils may be present. In flush wells, this facies is easily recognized by the white colour of the flushing fluid. In outcrop, it is easily recognized by the fact that on touching the fingers are stained white.In this Member, subhorizontal, ca. 1 to 2 dm thick stone beds, cemented by carbonate and by some opal (Fobe, 1986), are common. The stone beds have a high total carbonate content, even up to 80%, that occurs as cement, as marly laminations, as fossils and as rounded bioclast grains that are mixed with the quartz grains (Dusar et al., 2009, p. 242 & 330). When they occur, often several such subhorizontal sandstone beds are found over the vertical profile, separated by 0.5 to 1 m of uncemented sand. These carbonate sandstones have in the past been used as building stones (ann. 2). At the historic type locality, Brussels and its immediate surroundings, this unit is predominantly found near the top of the Formation (Dumont, 1839; Rutot & Van den Broeck, 1883). In the area NE of Brussels, the sandstone is called “Diegem sandstone”, in the area between Tienen and Jodoigne, the “Gobertange sandstone” is found, while in the wide area around Braine-l’Alleud and Nivelles, a similar stone called “grès calcareux du Bruxellien” (the name of “central Brabant sandstone” is proposed here) occurs. The Diegem sandstone mostly represents stone from the Brussels Formation but also partially from the Lede Formation sandstone, where it is found on top of the Brussels Formation. The stone layers in both formations have a similar aspect but Lede stones have less well sorted quartz grains, may contain 1-2 mm quartz grains and have more varied fossil remains. The Gobertange sandstone has in the 19th and first half of the 20th century been quarried and exported as building stone on an almost industrial scale (Tordoir, 2000). This stone is characterized by very thin white marl laminae perforated by burrows, filled with glauconite-rich medium to coarse sand. South and southeast of Brussels, in the wide area around Braine-l’Alleud and Nivelles, and locally around Grez-Doiceau (ann. 2), carbonate sandstones are found, which have an aspect very similar to the Diegem sandstone though in this area some layers attain a thickness of over 3 dm and the proportion of medium sand may be higher. Local variants may be found, e.g. finely laminated calcareous sandstone at Rood Klooster/Rouge Cloître (Oudergem/Auderghem). Capriciously shaped, hard, often small (at most 1 dm) siliceous concretions (“grès fistuleux” and “pierres de grottes”) are frequent in this facies; in fact, their presence is a diagnostic for separating it from surrounding, similar strata such as the Lede Formation. In calcareous facies, the siliceous concretions may contain carbonate elements. The Member is often decalcified. Decalcification caused a change in colour: it is yellowish or greenish brown due to the fact that non soluble grains such as fine-grained glauconite are concentrated and grains are limonite coated. Decalcification is found only in the outcrop area and there tends to occur primarily near the flanks of the valleys (geomorphology) and near the surface (vadose zone). Decalcification fronts are generally very sharp and may form capricious surfaces. Decalcification is caused by dissolution of carbonates in permeating water. The process is recent (related to the present landscape evolution) and is still ongoing.As it is decalcified, the facies no longer contains carbonate cemented sandstones and the chalcedony cemented concretions have turned brittle. In outcrop, the occurrence of capricious brittle siliceous sandstones or ghosts provides a good diagnostic. An important consequence of this superficial weathering is that the sand becomes undercompacted and loses nearly all compressional strength. The alteration depth is in the metric scale but may exceed 10 m and its distribution is erratic. Recording the alteration is of great importance for geotechnical applications.",Brussels Formation,,"Problematic, not permanently exposed. Building sites near Diegem and in Braine-lAlleud often show the calcareous facies of this Member. The Waversesteenweg entrance to the RBINS museum at Brussels (Lambert 72 X 150546, Y 169493, outcrop from about 61 to 70 m TAW) also showed this facies, but the exposure is now walled up. It would make a meaningful stratotype. An alternative could be the Hussompont sandpit west of Jodoigne (X 183440, Y 158190, outcrop from about 87.5 to 104 m TAW), but at present, access to the site is difficult to obtain. The abandoned sand extraction pit at Waterloo in the Soignes Forest, situated between the R0 and the N5b (Chaussée de Tervuren), X 152955, Y 155810, shows the decalcified facies of this Member but the outcrop would need to be refreshed.",https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/machelen-member/

In the exposure area Leuven-Tienen-Tongeren, the Berg Member consists of yellowish to pale grey, slightly glauconitic, medium-grained quartz sand. It is expected that under the water table the sand may turn more greyish. In the about 6 m thick outcrop section the lower part is clearly horizontally bedded with a 150-175 ?m grain-size modal value but the upper part is more homogeneous and cohesive with a modal size of 100-125 ?m and clay fraction approaching 10% at the top (Gullentops, 1988 p. 242-243).

Palynology in the Maaseik (049W0220) borehole points to upper Pliocene, latest Reuver C for the upper part of the Jagersborg  Member while the lower part of the Jagersborg Member (57,6-87,5 m)( base Stramproy Formation and top Kieseloolite Formation in H30 report interpretation) has a similar palynology as the Maat Lignite Bed in the Mol Formation (Vanhoorne in Vandenberghe et al., 2005). Vanhoorne et al. (1999) suggest that Jagersborg Member in the broader Maaseik-Kinrooi area could be Praetiglian.","Sometimes Jagersborg/Schinveld is used in literature to point out the at least partial correspondence of the Belgian Jagersborg Sand with the Dutch Schinveld Sand. In the H30-project ( Vernes et al., 2018, annex D section 7 fig. 7.3) the sandy part in the interval interpreted as Jagersborg Member in the published Maaseik borehole (Vandenberghe et al., 2005) is interpreted as Stramproy Formation; neither Jagersborg nor Schinveld sand are interpreted in this H30-project stratigraphy and at present neither of both terms is still described in the Dutch DINOloket.","The Jagersborg Member is also reported in the regional review for the geological map 18-10 Maaseik + Beverbeek ( Sels et al., 2001). On the map and the profiles accompanying the map, the sand unit above the Brunssum clay I unit  is mapped as Jagersborg Member over the whole area east of the Reppel Roer Valley Graben bordering fault. The name Jagersborg Sand has been introduced by Vanhoorne et al. (1999) for white quartz sand underlying the Meuse gravel in the area. Nevertheless, the map authors recognise that possibly part of the sand unit could be the Early Pleistocene fluviatile Kedichem Formation (nowadays included in the Waalre Formation (Westerhoff, 2009, p16) on top of the Jagersborg Sand as also interpreted by Van der Sluys (2000). In a regional profile (Vandenberghe et al., 2005, fig.10) all except the Maaseik (049W0220) boreholes have the Stramproy Formation sand overlying the Jagersborg/Schinveld unit. The Stramproy Formation is deposited by rivers that drained the Belgian area in contrast to the  about time-equivalent mixed Meuse-Rhine river deposits of the Waalre Formation; the former is characterised by dominantly stable heavy minerals and the latter by unstable heavy minerals ( Westerhoff, 2009, p 16). In the present practice also more clayey layers are included and a gradual transition to the Kieseloolite Formation is reported (TNO-GDN, 2021) explaining why in the H3O report (Vernes et al., 2018) the Stramproy Formation is also interpreted in the Maaseik (049W0220) borehole between 22 and 63.2 m depth.","Vandenberghe, N., & Dusar, M.",,,"Vandenberghe, N., & Dusar, M., 2023.

The reason is that within the Rupelian stage (R), two assises were distinguished (R1 & R2); within each of these marine cycles or assises a theoretical sedimentary cycle was assumed with successive facies a (gravel), b (transgressive sand), c (deeper marine clay) and d (regressive sand) (Rutot, 1883). As the Kerniel Sand at Kerniel near Borgloon (Looz) interpreted by Van den Broeck (1893 p. 270) as a stratigraphically independent sand unit between two deeper marine clay units, the argile à Nucula comta (Kleine Spouwen Member) and the argile à Leda Deshayesiana (Boom Formation), this intermediate Kerniel Sand unit needs to be composed of a succession of regressive sand, a base gravel and an overlying transgressive sand, labelled respectively as R1d, R2a and R2b. In the Stratigraphic Register (Anonymous, 1929,1932) the sand unit corresponding to the Kerniel Sand is not listed. On the recent 1: 50 000 geological maps the coding for the Kerniel Sand is BiKe.","The Kerniel Member occurs in South Limburg: northeast and east on the geological map sheet Sint-Truiden and north on the map sheet Tongeren (Claes et al., 2001; Claes & Gullentops, 2001) (Figure 7). Further northwards in the subsurface, the member can be identified on geophysical logs as far north as the boreholes Koewijde-KS2 (Figure 3, 9), Dornerheide-KS6 (Figure 8a), and Ruwmortelsheide-KS22 (063E0222 and Vandenberghe et al. 2001 fig. 9), whilst west of these boreholes the Kerniel Member, as well as the Kleine-Spouwen Member are absent in the Opglabbeek-KS19 borehole (Figure 8a and Vandenberghe et al. 2001 fig. 9).","Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L.",,,"Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L., 2024.

The sand has been described as clayey at the base and fining towards the top. Occasional layers of Glycymeris obovata (Lamarck, 1819) shells and marine shell imprints have been described in the upper part. Other characteristic species are Arctica islandica rotundata (Agassiz, 1845), Pycnodonte queteleti (Nyst,1853), Hilberia hoeninghausi (Defrance, 1825) (Vervoenen, 1995; Baut & Génault, 1999). Except for some reworked foraminifera, no microfauna has been observed. Small lignite fragments are occasionally present. In Limburg the gravel in the middle of the sand unit is reported to be well developed and consists of rounded quartz and flint pebbles (from Van den Broeck 1893 p 285, 280; Gulinck, 1954; Batjes, 1958; Kruissink et al., 1978; Claes et al., 2001; Claes & Gullentops, 2001). As the Kerniel Sand Member is seldom exposed, the Gellik-Eigenbilzen Albert Canal section in the early 90s of the previous century is an exceptional outcrop worth mentioning. The section was studied for fossils by Vervoenen (1995) and Baut & Génault (1999). Remarkably in the middle of the 9-10 m thick sand section the last authors describe a dm thick shell grit layer (op.cit. fig.4) with a wavy eroding base (op.cit. fig.3) containing fish and other vertebrate remains and also small white quartz pebbles, undoubtedly the same level described by Steurbaut et al. (1999) with channels, gravel and oblique lamination. This observation seems to fit the subdivision in three units labelled R1d, R2a, R2b by Van den Broeck (1893) as discussed above.",Bilzen Formation,"Thickness of the Kerniel Sand Member varies from 5-7 m on average to maximal 10 m (Claes et al., 2001; Claes & Gullentops, 2001).","Van den Broeck (1883) refers to the railroad Looz (Borgloon)-Kerniel, at Kerniel, a section in which he originally had erroneously taken the Kerniel Sand for boldérien sableux (Van den Broeck, 1893 p 270) (an interpretation still held for possible by Gullentops, oral com.). This railroad section is point 163 in Glibert & de Heinzelin (1954, p 299 and map fig.4). In the close vicinity Glibert & de Heinzelin (op. cit.) report an open sand pit in the Kerniel Sand at their point 164 and a few other outcrops.
In the subsurface the sand lithology of the Kerniel Member between the clays of the Kleine Spouwen Member and the Boom Formation is easily recognized on geophysical logs (examples Figures 3, 8b, 9 and Vandenberghe et al., 2001 fig. 9).",https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/kerniel-member/

It also occurs as outliers in the top zones of the South? Flemish hills. On a regional scale the base of the Vlierzele is erosive into underlying strata (see also Fobe, 1989b, 1995). In northern Flanders the grainsize properties of the Vlierzele Member seem to be more variable (Laga & Vandenberghe, 1990 p 1; Fobe, 1993, 1995). The boundary between the clayey sediment of the Pittem Member and the overlying Vlierzele Sand can mostly be traced with reasonable confidence in the geophysical log correlation profiles by Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009). On the legend of the 1:40 000 maps the Vlierzele Member is coded P1d and P1n for the upper clayey facies. In the stratigraphic register (1929, 1932) the Vlierzele Member is included in the Y2 division. The P1n?clay, defined by Rutot (1890) and described as a local top clay in the Vlierzele Sand (Gulinck & Hacqaert, 1954) is believed to correspond in fact to the Merelbeke Clay (Fobe, 1995; Buffel et al., 2009).","Steurbaut, E., De Ceukelaire, M., Lanckacker, T., Matthijs, J., Stassen, P., Van Baelen, H. & Vandenberghe, N.",,,"Steurbaut, E., De Ceukelaire, M., Lanckacker, T., Matthijs, J., Stassen, P., Van Baelen, H. & Vandenberghe, N., 2017.

National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium. http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/Vlierzele-Member",09/01/2017,"In the recent literature, based on outcrop observations, the Vlierzele Member is described as consisting of a lower part of mostly bioturbated, slightly clayey, glauconitic sand and an upper section of alternating units of tidal cross?bedding with mud drapes and structureless intercalations; the upper section may contain lignite lumps (Houthuys, 1990). In the recent literature, based on outcrops, the Vlierzele Member is described as consisting of fine glauconitic green?grey mostly bioturbated sand, finely laminated horizontally and in cross stratification. Towards the base the sands becomes clayey and more homogeneous. Towards the top individualised clay layers occur together with humic intercalations. Macrofossils are very rare. Thin cemented siliceous sandstone beds commonly occur (Geets et al., 2000); irregularly shaped siliceous sandstone concretions are also common. The maximal thickness is about 20 m; in the type locality the cross bedded sand above is 7m thick and the lower homogeneous sand at least 5 m (see sections in Houthuys & Gullentops, 1988 p 142). Fobe (1995), after reviewing information available from more than 25 localities, considers the traditional Vlierzele sand sensu stricto as only one of 5 members in a formation between the Pittem Member and the Aalter Sand in the Zenne Group. Steurbaut (2006) reports erroneous correlations in Fobes (op.cit.) subdivisions ; the Beernem sand, traditionally a member of the Aalter Formation of the Zenne Group (Maréchal & Laga,1988 p 120?121; Geets et al., 2000), is included in the Vlierzele unit by Fobe and the existence of a distinct Aalterbrugge unit is refuted by this author. Therefore the present review is not following the interpretations by Fobe (1995, 1997) but recognizes that the clayey basis, a 3?10m very fine clayey sand with mm?thick clay layers, (Lochristi layer sensu Fobe) and locally a thin coarser basal layer (Hijfte layer sensu Fobe) merit a separate mention aside the traditional Vlierzele sand sensu stricto (which according to Fobe 1995,1997 could be named Oosterzele unit).",Gentbrugge Formation,,"The Vlierzele locality is part of the Sint?Lievens?Houtem municipality in the East Flanders province where several extractions have been active in the past.

However this stratotype is limited to the Vlierzele sand sensu stricto. Following Fobe (1995), as far as the Vlierzele sensu stricto, the Lochristi and Hijfte layers are concerned, the Ursel borehole (039W0212 x= 87.910, y= 204.260, z= + 29 m TAW) shows the Vlierzele Member between 58 and 69,3 m with the Vlierzele sand sensu stricto between 58?63 m, Lochristi layerbetween 63?66 m and the Hijfte layer between 66?69,3 m.",https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/vlierzele-member/

It has a homogeneous appearance, except for possible irregular brownish intercalations due to oxidation above the groundwater table, linked to groundwater fluctuations. Glauconite content is significantly lower in the Beerzel Member compared to the underlying Hallaar Member (2–6%, glauconite/quartz ratio of 0.02–0.08).

Feldspar content remains largely constant within the member (4–6%, feldspar/quartz ratio of 0.05– 0.08). On CPT’s, the Beerzel Member can be identified based on an interval with constant qc values, a bit higher than in the underlying and overlying members.

The Lichtaart Sand Member contains neither calcareous fossils nor carbonates in general.",Kasterlee Formation,"In the type area Herentals-Lichtaart-Kasterlee a thickness of about 15 m is interpreted in sections drafted by Laga and Gulinck (Laga, 1976) and confirmed by a CPT log interpretation (10-CPTE-138). In the boreholes of the Turnhout area, Gierle (017W0158/kb8d17w-B14), Rees (017E0399/kb8d17e-B495), Oud-Turnhout (017E 0401;kb817e-B497) and Turnhout (017E0398; kb8d17e-B294), the Lichtaart Member occurs underneath the Poederlee Sand and thickness is reduced to 8 to 11 m. Towards the border with the Netherlands in the north of the Antwerp province, the Kasterlee Formation, probably the Lichtaart Member, is suggested to thicken in the profiles drafted by Laga (1976).","The occasional outcrops in the flanks of the hills between Herentals, Lichtaart and Kasterlee on the right bank of the Kleine Nete valley always expose the top part of the Kasterlee Formation. Therefore these outcrops are always part of the Lichtaart Member. They were selected as the type section for the Kasterlee Formation in the Lithostratigraphic scale of Belgium (2001) although the lower part of the formation was never exposed in the hill ridge. These outcrops in fact show the southern glauconite-poor Hoge Berg Facies.
Several boreholes in the Turnhout area contain reference data on the Lichtaart Member, where the northern glauconite-rich Oud-Turnhout Facies is present. The reference section selected for the Lichtaart Member is in the Rees borehole (017E0399; kb8d17e-B495). The full section described as Kasterlee Formation between 25 and 33,5 m is interpreted as the Lichtaart Member. Cores, sediment analyses and dinoflagellate cyst analyses are available in this interval (Buffel et al., 2001; Vandenberghe et al., 2020). The Kasterlee Formation  in the Gierle borehole (017W0158 ; Kb8d17w-B14) between 26 and 34 m is also identified as the Lichtaart Member and has detailed grain-size analyses (Gullentops and Huyghebaert, 1999).  Although the base of the Lichtaart Member is not reached in the Oud-Turnhout  borehole (017E 0401;kb817e-B497), a section of about 11 m of the Lichtaart Member between 39 and 50 m with sediment analyses is juxtaposed to a gamma-ray log of the similar interval in the nearby Turnhout borehole (017E0398; kb8d17e-B294) in Louwye et al.

The Bruyelle Member, 01/12/2017. National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium. http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/Bruyelle-Member",01/12/2017,"The Bruyelle Member corresponds to the traditional “Dièves moyennes” and “Dièves supérieures”. In the type area it could be observed in temporary and partial outcrops along the TGV  line, especially West of Bruyelle village and in the overburden of abandoned limestone quarries in the Rieu de Barges SW of Tournai (Hennebert & Doremus, 1997a, b). It consists , from top to bottom of:
– 5 – 10 m of whitish grey marl without silicifications;
– 2 – 10 m of greenish grey marl, with phosphatic granules of upwards decreasing frequency and with fine to coarse glauconite grains;
– max 1 m transgressive layer with varnish-green to brown (when phosphatised) pebbles are embedded in a greenish grey marl with coarse glauconite grains, locally very fossiliferous (rhynchonellids, terebratulids, oysters, …) of “Faux Tourtia” facies. This diachronous unit marks the base of the Turonian transgression.
In the area transitional to the Mons basin (Péruwelz, Hennebert, 1999a, b) the succession becomes more complete, allowing a threefold subdivision and comparable to the traditional French subdivision, from top to bottom:
– chalky marl, white under dry conditions, with terebratulids, known as “Dièves supérieurs” or “Dièves bleues” in France;
– greenish grey clayey marls, with Inoceramus labiatus, known as “Dièves moyennes” or “Dièves vertes” in France;
– green to grey strongly clayey marls, known as “Dièves inférieures” or “Dièves multicolores” or “Assise de Saint-Aybert” in France, resting on a phosphatic pebble bed.
In the parastratotype area of the Flemish region observations are based on cores and geophysical well logs, allowing a less detailed but more consistent description. Cuttings (110W0007) consist of desintegrated bright green marly silt, becoming dark coloured and  more cohesive with depth; dispersed clasts of reddish brown clay; coarse quartz grains and mollusc shell debris increase with depth. The reddish brown clay bears some resemblance to the underlying Paleozoic strata which consist of violaceous shales. Top of the Frasnian shales has become slightly weathered but shows no signs of paleosol development (Tourneur et al., 1988). Mesofossils are characterized by a high frequency of foraminifers for an overall low number of bioclasts in the 1 – 2,4 mm mesh range (Felder, 1990, 1994). Cores (095W0153) display two subunits. The upper subunit consists of green silty marl, originally stratified but bioturbated, fossil-bearing (oyster shells, Inoceramus, sponge structures), displaying core dessication cracks, interbedded with ca 25 cm thick layers in bright green indurated silty chalk with poorly preserved mollusk shells, sponge structures, fish remains. The lower subunit displays thin lenses of calcarenitic glauconite-bearing chalk, partly silicified, interbedded with green marl, quickly becoming predominant and also more coarse-grained and richer in glauconite. Towards the base, but dispersed in the sediment, reworked pebbles of Cretaceous origin. Microfacies analysis from thin sections indicate an outer shelf depositional environment composed of bioclastic wackestone with foraminifers, calcispheres and molluscs (subunit 1 at 193.9 m) and bioclastic packstone with coarse glauconite grains and lithoclasts (subunit 2 at 216.1 and 217.6 m). Porosity values from image analysis attain 0,15% and 1.6% respecively (Lagrou et al., 2011). The natural gamma-ray log delineates these two subunits. The upper subunit (underneath a gamma-ray peak at the base of the upper member) is still of chalky-marly nature with rising gamma-ray readings towards the base, indicative for increasing glauconite content. The lower subunit is characterized by overall very high gamma-ray reading, indicative for clayey greensand. Therefore, the stratigraphic succession observed in boreholes in the Flemish region seems to confirm the subdivision in different units in the type area.",Vert Galand Formation,"In the type area from 5 to over 20 m.

The subdivision of the Diest Formation into members still necessitates further study (Houthuys et al. 2020; Goolaerts et al., 2020). The present views lead to maintaining the Dessel Member and Deurne Member and introducing the Hageland Diest Member, Kempen Diest Member and the Borsbeek Member.
The local facies “clayey Diest” and “Bosbeek/Opoeteren” (see location in Vandenberghe & Louwye, 2020, Fig. 3, added in annex 2) need better descriptions of extent, correlations and depositional structures. Therefore, no formal members inside the Diest Formation are proposed for these facies now.",,General evolution from less than 10 m in the west and southwest of its extent to almost 200 m in NE Belgium inside the Roer Valley Graben. Important thickness variations in Hageland and Zuiderkempen are related to the incised nature of the formation base. The thickness reaches more than 100 m in the centre of some of those incisions.,"The type locality is Diest, where exposures were available at the former town fortress. In the wide neighbourhood of Diest, exposures are temporarily offered at construction sites. The exposures represent only the Hageland Diest Member. A key permanent outcrop is present at the Kesselberg in Leuven.

An interval of 31 m between 102 and 133 m deep is described as poorly glauconitic fine clayey and also carbonate containing homogeneous sand. This sand interval has a characteristic gamma-ray profile: a cyclic evolution with a middle very low gamma-ray signal; the resistivity values increase upwards but above the middle part of the interval resistivities remain high in two lobes. (Figure 36 1). The stratigraphic interpretation is unsure. Laga & Notebaert (1981) have opted to consider the sand as a glauconite poor part of the underlying Diest Formation. The sand above was interpreted by these authors as the Kattendijk Formation. However on regional profiles drawn in the mid and late 1970s by Laga for the Groundwater Commission of the Province of Antwerp (Archives of the Geological Survey of Belgium), the Poppel Facies obviously is not yet indicated as it was not yet described, but on the profiles PGL/76/106/3 (Poppel-Ravels-Turnhout) and PGL 76/106/2 (Poppel-Ravels-Dessel) (Laga, 1976), this Poppel Facies would geometrically have been included in about 45 m of fine glauconitic sand interpreted as Kasterlee Formation sand below the Lillo Formation with shell debris and overlying the Diest Formation (Vandenberghe et al. , 2020 figs 7a&b). Nevertheless, the presence of carbonates in the sand is not in line with either the classical Kasterlee Formation or the Diest Formation. Another complicating factor is that the geometrical relay of Kattendijk Sand in the west by Kasterlee Sand in the east is shown to occur in the Weelde area on profile PGL/74/105 (Laga, 1976). Given the carbonate content of the Poppel Facies a lateral correlation of this unit with the carbonate containing Kattendijk Formation is plausible. Based on log correlations between Belgium and the Netherlands in the northwestern Campine area (Vernes et al., 2023), the Poppel Facies may be correlated with the Goirle Member of the Oosterhout Formation (see Fig. 35.2). The overlying Kattendijk Formation is the lateral equivalent of the Tilburg Member of the Oosterhout Formation, while the underlying Diest Formation can be correlated with the Diessen Formation. Based on this correlation, a position of the Poppel Facies as a basal unit of the Kattendijk Formation in the Voorkempen area may be proposed. More data are required before the interval can be given its definitive stratigraphic position.",,A thickness of 31 m is interpreted in the Weelde borehole (BGD 008E0133).,The borehole Weelde (BGD 008E0133; DOV kb8d8e-B26) between 102-133 m.,https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/poppel-facies/

A bipolar grain size distribution is often present in the sedimentary facies X. If a fraction of fine sand is present, a small admixture (much less than 2%) of very fine, light green glauconite pellets is always found. The Bierbeek Member may either contain a considerable admixture (from 5 to up to about 30%) of coarse dark green to blackish glauconite pellets (this tends to be the case in the east of the basin) or it can be devoid of such glauconite (in the west and southeast of the basin). The cementations have different shapes and sizes and are of the type with chalcedony to microquartz cement; also their content may vary. Very well-sorted beds tend to have low numbers of siliceous concretions; beds with mud laminae like in the bottomsets of cross-beds tend to have higher contents of siliceous concretions.

Note that the age for the GSSP Chattian is slightly different (27,82 Ma) in the ICS chart (2023/4). Chronostratigraphic anchoring is based on magnetostratigraphy (Lagrou et al., 2004) and on nannoplankton and dinoflagellate biostratigraphy. The identification of D. biffi in Van Simaeys et al. (2005) has not been withheld (for arguments see 5.1 in Munsterman and Deckers, 2020). The hiatus between Rupelian and Chattian is mainly situated in Rupelian time (see also Coccioni et al., 2018). In addition age intervals within the Rupel Group are based on the obliquity cycles in the ON-Mol-2D borehole (Vandenberghe et al., 2022) starting with the base of Rupel Group at 32 Ma (NP22/NP23 boundary). A silicified foraminifera event is considered the start of the tectonic tilting with uplift and erosion in the west (De Man et al., 2010). The boundary between the Rupel Group and the overlying Veldhoven Formation (line 4) is a low angle unconformity (Dusar and Vandenberghe, 2020 3.2) and in northeast Belgium at this level the RVG graben fault activity resumes depositing much thicker Chattian deposits in the graben. The hiatus between the top of the Rupel Group and the base of the Chattian Voort Sand is dated following De Man et al. (2010) and Coccioni et al. (2018). The age of the basal Voort Sand is put at the start of the Svalbardella interval including the Asterigerina horizon almost at the NP24/NP25 boundary (Coccioni et al., 2018 table 1; Speijer et al., 2020 fig.28.11). Assuming the latter boundary only slightly deviates from the North Sea NP24*/NP25* proxy (De Man et al., 2010), the Voort Sand outlier in the Antwerp area is correlated to this nannoplankton boundary (Vandenberghe et al., 2004).","The present LIS is a further elaboration of the previous NCS website version of the Rupel Group by the same authors. Note however that in contrast to earlier versions of the stratigraphic inventory, the Voort Sand is no longer included in the present definition of the Rupel Group. This follows from the integration of the mainly Chattian sand and clay units, such as the Voort Sand, into the Veldhoven Formation of Chattian to Aquitanian age (De Nil & Verhaegen, 2022) occurring dominantly in the RVG; hence further including these units in the Rupel Group would expand this group too far outside its core area of occurrence.","The deposits of the Rupel Group occur north of the rivers Durme, Rupel, Dijle, and of the line Leuven-Tongeren. Along the southern rim of this area, the Rupel Group crops out. The deposits dip to the north and are therefore present in the subsurface of the Antwerp Campine and Limburg Campine areas (Figure 1b).","Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L.",,"Bilzen Formation, Boom Formation, Eigenbilzen Formation","Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L., 2024.

These comprise on the one hand the superjacent much sandier Eigenbilzen Sand Formation displaying in some outcrops the typical rhythmicity of the Boom Clay and considered as a geometrical and mainly lateral equivalent of part of the Boom Clay. On the other hand in East-Limburg a sandy unit, the Kerniel Sand, splits up the main clay unit in two parts: the overlying clay designated as Boom Clay and the thinner underlying clay unit as the Kleine-Spouwen Clay (Van den Broeck, 1883a,b). Also included in the Rupel Group is the coastal Berg Sand, underlying the Kleine-Spouwen Clay; in some areas the Berg Sand also occurs below the Boom Clay where it is a paleogeographical lateral evolution of the lower part of the Boom Clay. The Kerniel Sand, Kleine-Spouwen Clay and Berg Sand are grouped as members into the Bilzen Formation.
Lithologically and from a sedimentary sequence genetic perspective the lagoonal to shallow marine Ruisbroek Sand unit underlying the Boom Clay in the northwestern part of the occurrence area of the Rupel Group could be included into the Rupel Group (Vandenberghe et al., 2002), but as it occurs in the top of an alternation of lithostratigraphic clay and sand units, originally abbreviated a (argile) and s (sable) and grouped as the Complexe argilo-sableux de Kallo by Gulinck (1969), it has been grouped as a member in the Zelzate Formation of the Tongeren Group (see NCS website). An analogous remark could be made about the Borgloon Formation of the Tongeren Group underlying the Rupel Group in its southern and eastern occurrence area as these deposits make up the initial sediments of the important transgression that will later deposit the Rupel Group sediments (Vandenberghe et al., 2003).",,"The maximal thickness in North Belgium is about 140 m (Weelde SCK 98 borehole) and about 120 m in the Mol-Dessel area (Figure 2). Compared to the North Belgium area the Rupel Group was eroded by about 80 m towards the Antwerp area (De Man et al., 2010). In the outcrop zone along the Rupel river the thickness is even further reduced to about 40 m (Reet borehole ). In the Land van Waas area only the lower part of the Rupel Group is preserved, about 12 m clay is exposed in the former clay pit at Sint-Niklaas (SVK pit). Along the Albert Canal in Southeast Limburg the Rupel Group thickness is about 45 m (Figure 3).","The Rupel Group is slightly dipping to the north-northeast (Figure 1b). It reaches the surface at the south-southwestern rim of its occurrence area, except in the northern Hageland, where channel erosion and channel infill has removed the Rupel Group sediments and replaced it by the Neogene Diest Formation. As a consequence, two main outcrop areas can be considered: a western area comprising the Land van Waas, the Rupel area and the Nete-Dijle interfluvium, and an eastern area comprising the southern Hageland and the Demer area in Limburg (Figure 1a).
As reference sections for the Rupel Group in the Antwerp Campine, the cored and geophysically logged boreholes at Weelde (SCK 98) and Mol (SCK-15), together with ON-Mol-1 and ON-Dessel-1, are chosen as representative for the Eigenbilzen and Boom Formations (Figure 2).

At the top of the Retie Member drilling mud is reported to start colouring slightly green, obviously on the condition that at the start clear water is used to make up the drilling fluid. By colour, the Retie Member can hardly be distinguished in boreholes from the overlying Donk Member. In the Retie-Geel-Kasterlee area only a notable size fraction >250 µm in the Donk Formation allows to detect the boundary between both members. Eastwards, in the Mol-Dessel area the grain size of the the Donk Member becomes coarser and the boundary with the underlying Retie Member is clear (Vandenberghe et al., 2020, fig.2). In the Poppel-Rauw Fault area and eastwards of it, a relatively thin but marked high gamma-ray clayey bed occurs on top of the Retie Member sand that is named informally the ‘level 3 clay’ bed and on top of which the drilling mud starts to become green. Below the Retie Member occurs the much more clayey Heist-op-den-Berg Member of the Kasterlee Formation in the Retie-Geel-Kasterlee-Dessel area and the boundary is marked by a clear gamma-ray signal increase in the top of the Heist-op-den-Berg Member. In the Poppel-Rauw Fault area and eastwards of it, occurs a slightly coarser unit, the informal ‘level 1-2 sand’ of the Mol Formation. The top of the latter is indicated by the start of a trend in gamma-ray and resistivity signals whereas in the Retie Member these signals are stable. Although the few grain-size data available in the top of the ‘level 1-2 sand’ suggest a coarser grain size compared to the Retie Member, the gamma ray signal of the ‘level 1-2 sand’ unit is higher (Vandenberghe et al., 2020) requiring  further data.",Mol Formation,"Between Kasterlee and Mol-Dessel the thickness varies between 7 and 22 m and from the Poppel-Rauw Fault zone and eastwards of it, the thickness is about 25 m.","The reference for the Retie Member is the section between 8 and 19,5 m in the ONDRAF-NIRAS  ON-Retie-2 (031W0375) borehole, of which also geophysical data , sediment analyses and a CPT log  are available ( Vandenberghe et al., 2020).

The grain size central value is comprised between a lower value range of 150 to 175 ?m and an upper value range of 250 to 300 ?m. The carbonate content (if not decalcified) is between 2 and 15%; most of this is fine mud. Micro- and macrofossils are often present. Commonly, the sand is moderately sorted and a fraction of fine sand is present. In that case, always a small admixture (much less than 2%) of very fine, light green glauconite pellets is found. This unit has low to medium dark glauconite content facies. In certain areas, a gradually increasing admixture of coarser, dark green to blackish coloured glauconite pellets has been observed (ann. 1). The dominant primary sedimentary structure is parallel master bedding, inclined at a small angle and dipping to ESE. The master beds show a gradually decreasing slope near the bottom of the Formation. Thin and thicker, up to 1 m thick, cross beds occur and are incorporated in the master fill style. Sometimes they constitute stacks of cross beds. The cross beds have a (very) dominant foreset dip to NNE, with rare occurrences of dips to SSW, and numerous mud drapes testifying to tidal currents. In numerous outcrops, the sand is strongly homogenized due to bioturbation. Between the opposites of relatively non-bioturbated cross beds and completely homogenized beds, all possible grades of increasing bioturbation occur. Locally, faintly wavy to structureless bedding is present in sharply bounded packages. In most cases, numerous siliceous concretions are present, varying from capriciously shaped “grès fistuleux” (including “pierres de grottes”) to slab-shaped “grès lustrés”. They tend to be very hard and make drilling and excavating difficult. In structureless facies, siliceous stones are rare and often spherical, to absent. No carbonate stone beds occur. In places where this Member has been decalcified, the Member remains identifiable by its grain size. Decalcification brings about a change in colour: it has turned yellow, brownish yellow or greenish brown due to the fact that non soluble grains such as glauconite are concentrated and grains are limonite coated. Often, local limonite cementation has occurred during or following decalcification. Decalcification is found only in the outcrop area and in this case tends to occur primarily near the flanks of the valleys (geomorphology) and near the surface (vadose zone). Decalcification fronts are generally sharp and may form capricious surfaces. In the decalcified facies of the Unit, the chalcedony cemented concretions have turned more or less brittle.",Brussels Formation,,"De Kock sandpit in Ganzemansstraat, Neerijse (X 167320, Y 167360, lower and middle part of sandpit face, approximately from about 45 to 60 m TAW).

The Waasland clay included the present Belsele-Waas and Terhagen Members. In the section by Vandenberghe (1980) it was indicated as part of the Argile grise.
The Terhagen Member of the Boom Clay Formation is included pro parte in the unit labelled R2c on the geological map 1:40 000 (Anonymous, 1892,1896,1900,1909) and pro parte in the unit labelled R2b in the Stratigraphic Register (Anonymous, 1929, 1932). On the recent 1: 50 000 geological maps the Terhagen Member is coded BmTe.","The Terhagen Member occurs in the same area as the Boom Clay Formation. The Boom Clay Formation outcrops in the Waasland area, north of the Rupel river, between the Grote Nete and the Dijle-Demer rivers, and in southern Limburg (Figure 1a). North of this outcrop area, the clay occurs in the subsurface except for some locations in the Hageland where the erosion surface underlying the late Miocene Diest Formation has locally removed the Boom Clay Formation.","Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L.",,,"Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L., 2024. The Terhagen Member, 05/04/2024. National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium. http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/Terhagen-Member",05/04/2024,"The Terhagen Member is the part of the Boom Clay in between the Belsele-Waas Member and the Putte Member. If the former member is not present, the Terhagen Member occurs at the base of the Boom Clay Formation above the Bilzen Formation. The Terhagen Member is a banded pale grey clay consisting of a several-dm-scale alternation of silt-enriched and clay-enriched layers (Figure 12). This banded nature is in contrast with the thick silt layers of the underlying Belsele-Waas Member. The pale grey colour is in contrast with the overlying Putte Member which is darker grey to even black stained. The black staining is due to layers with a few percent silt-sized detrital plant particles and such layers in the Terhagen Member are well expressed only at two levels, although under particular conditions a few more very subtle ones can be observed (Figures 13, 14, 15, 16). In the middle of the Terhagen Member occurs a characteristic pinkish to brownish stained silty layer labelled R-horizon (Figures 12, 14, 15, 16). In its part below the R-horizon the clay is calcareous (Figure 15), above the R-horizon carbonate is only occasionally present (Vandenberghe et al., 2014 fig. 11). Septaria horizons S10, S20 (key layer for correlation), S30 and S40 (Figures 12, 13, 14 and photographs 2 & 7 in Vandenberghe (1978)) occur in the Terhagen Member. In the subsurface of the Mol-Dessel area a geophysical continuous carbonate content log has shown a periodicity in the carbonate content all along the complete Boom Clay section, also in the Terhagen Member (Vandenberghe et al., 2022).",Boom Formation,The thickness varies between 20 and 25 m.,"The Terhagen Member type area is the Rupel-cuesta exploitation area where it general forms the lower part of the extracted clay. The active clay extraction pits have shifted in the past but are located  around x= 154 000 , y= 197 500 and Z =+30. An almost complete section of the Terhagen Member is given by Vandenberghe (1978, photo 2 p. 25). In the field and on geophysical well logs, the Terhagen Member is fairly easily picked between the top of the silty Belsele-Waas Member (Figures 2 and 15) and the overlying Putte Member (Figures 13, 16). The boundary with the Belsele-Waas Member is identified by the sudden incursion of clay expressed by a low resistivity signal (lowest oblique black arrow 1 on logs in Vandenberghe et al., 2001 figs. 3, 5-7 /Figures 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d, 11). On geophysical GR logs the boundary with the overlying Putte Member is identified by a sudden increase in GR announcing the organic richer Putte Member (Figure 2).",https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/terhagen-member/

The presence of the NP24 biozone as reported in literature (see Vandenberghe et al., 2014; Vandenberghe, 2017) is uncertain as the NP24 range figured in De Man et al. (2010), Vandenberghe et al. (2012) and Coccioni et al. (2018) is different from the range in the review in Speijer et al. (2020) and used in the biostratigraphy zonation in Figure 5. The discrepancy is probably linked to the absence in the North Sea Basin of the typical NP24 markers (see discussion in De Man et al. (2010).","The Putte Member was included pro parte in the unit labelled R2c on the Geological maps 1: 40 0000 (Anonymous 1892,1896, 1900, 1909) and pro parte in the unit  labelled R2b in the Stratigraphical register (anonymous 1929,1932).

North of this outcrop area, the Putte Member occurs in the subsurface except for some locations in the Hageland where the erosion surface underlying the late Miocene Diest Formation has locally removed parts and even locally the total Boom Clay Formation.","Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L.",,,"Vandenberghe, N. & Wouters, L., 2024. The Putte Member, 05/04/2024. National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium. http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/Putte-Member",05/04/2024,"The Putte Member overlies the Terhagen Member and underlies the Boeretang Member. The Putte Member consists of an alternation of silt-enriched and clay-enriched layers, several dm thick up to over a meter near its top (Vandenberghe & Mertens, 2013). Also the Terhagen Member is layered but in contrast to it, the Putte Member additionally has black stained layers of a few dm at the basis of the clay-enriched layers (Figures 13 and 16). Therefore the Putte Member can be described as a dark grey clay in contrast to the paler grey Terhagen Member (Vandenberghe et al. 2014 fig.10; Vandenberghe, 1978, photo 6, p. 33). Characteristic beds in the Putte Clay are the 2 DB silty beds (Figures 17, 18), the platy septaria bed S50 and the sideritic septaria horizon S60 (Figure 12). From its base to about level S50, the Putte Clay has the thinnest layers of the Boom Clay Formation (Vandenberghe & Mertens, 2013). These features can be particularly well observed in the outcrop area (Figures 13, 16, 17, 18). However in the outcrop area the upper part of the Putte Member is significantly eroded compared to its more complete development in the subsurface. The Putte Clay Member in the subsurface keeps a fairly constant average gamma-ray and resistivity signal across the small wiggles which reflect the alternating silt-enriched and clay-enriched layers. This constant geophysical  signal is in contrast with the overlying Boeretang Member of which the resistivity starts to markedly increase upwards, across the wiggles pointing to a much larger silt content than the underlying Putte Member (Figure 2).",Boom Formation,The maximal thickness is slightly over 50 m in the northern Campine (Weelde SCK 98 borehole) but in the reference outcrop area it is reduced by erosion (15 m in Kruibeke-Burcht clay section and 8 m along the Rupel cuesta).,"The type section of the Putte Member is exposed in the upper part of the active clay exploitation front  along the  cuesta between Rumst and Boom (topographic map sheet 23/3-4 Boom-Mechelen) around the coordinates x =154 000, y = 197 500, z = + 30 m. As along the cuesta since some time the exploitation is limited to the Wienerberger clay pit at Rumst and the exploitation has changed from bucket bagger extraction to dragline excavating, also the Argex clay extraction pit at Kruibeke-Burcht can serve as reference section. Remark that the Putte Clay Member in the outcrop area is always eroded and incomplete. Therefore boreholes with cores and geophysical logs have also to be considered for reference to the complete Putte Member such as the Mol-Dessel area borehole sections and geophysical logs (Figure 2).",https://ncs.naturalsciences.be/lithostratigraphy/putte-member/

The benthic foraminifera from the Antwerpen Member are indicative for the mid-Miocene Uvigerina tenuipustulata – Elphidium inflatum Assemblage Zone (De Meuter & Laga, 1976), while the calcareous nannoplanton proposes a correlation with the late Burdigalian to Langhian NN4 Zone (Martini & Müller, 1973). Dinoflagellate cyst analysis demonstrates the presence of the Labyrinthodinium truncatum Zone, the Unipontidinium aquaeductus Zone and the Achomosphaera andalousiensis Zone and suggests deposition between 15.97 Ma and 12.8 Ma (Langhian – mid-Serravallian) (Louwye et al., 2000) (Figure 0‑2).
