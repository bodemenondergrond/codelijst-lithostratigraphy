The Aalbeke Member is mostly non calcareous. Small pale brown to yellow phosphate nodules are common in the Aalbeke Member. It can be pointed out that this pure clay unit is relatively thin and therefore can be mistaken for other even thinner clay units above, namely the Egemkapel and the Merelbeke units. To unequivocally identify these different clay?rich layers, a complete vertical succession is often required or support by micropaleontological characterisation. In most geophysical log responses the lower boundary of the Aalbeke Member is sharply marked; at present there is no field outcrop of the contact between the Roubaix and Aalbeke Members. It is strongly suspected that the top of the Aalbeke Member is an erosive contactas it is overlain by different lithological units in different areas: in clay pits in Aalbeke, it is overlain by the Mont?Panisel Member of the Hyon Formation, in central Flanders by the Kortemark Member, and in SE Flanders and Brabant by the Hyon Formation. Also, at the base of the overlying Kortemark Member in the De Simpel clay?pit erosion can be observed (Steurbaut, 1998; Vandenbergh et al., 1998). The upper boundary can be sharp (e.g. Kerksen borehole 086E0340 in compendium, data Geological Service Company; Brugge ? 023W0454) or more generally the upper part of the clay unit shows a gradual coarsening upward. In the latter case, the upper boundary of the Aalbeke Member in contact with the Kortemark Member is put at the top of this coarsening upwards section.\nWithin the Aalbeke Member outcrops in the Kortrijk area a pronounced pinkish silty layer of some dm thickness occurs. It might serve as a stratigraphic marker bed. However the bed is not given an official bed status as it is not yet established that only one such layer occurs in a complete Aalbeke Member section.",

The dispersed clay content is 3.7 ± 2.3% and the D90 of the grain size distribution is 352 ± 102 µm (De Meuter & Laga, 1976; Verhaegen, 2020). Characteristic are shell layers strongly dominated by Glycymeris baldii with a varying thickness. Some of these shell beds can be traced continuously across the entire type area (Deckers & Everaert, 2022). Layers with phosphatic concretions, friable sandstones, bones and shark teeth are present towards the base of the member. No clear basal gravel is present. The glauconite content ranges from 28% to locally as high as 85% and is on average 47%, which is the highest amount in any unit in the Campine Basin (Adriaens, 2015; Adriaens & Vandenberghe, 2020). The Antwerpen Member contains mostly authigenic glauconite (Vandenberghe et al., 2014; Odin & Kreuzer, 1988).",

(1988), and point towards a late Burdigalian to Langhian age. The benthic foraminifera from the Antwerpen Member are indicative for the mid-Miocene Uvigerina tenuipustulata – Elphidium inflatum Assemblage Zone (De Meuter & Laga, 1976), while the calcareous nannoplanton proposes a correlation with the late Burdigalian to Langhian NN4 Zone (Martini & Müller, 1973). Dinoflagellate cyst analysis demonstrates the presence of the Labyrinthodinium truncatum Zone, the Unipontidinium aquaeductus Zone and the Achomosphaera andalousiensis Zone and suggests deposition between 15.97 Ma and 12.8 Ma (Langhian – mid-Serravallian) (Louwye et al., 2000) (Figure 0‑2). The radiometric datings of glauconites from the Antwerpen Member give a K-Ar age of 20 Ma and a Rb-Sr age of 18.5 Ma to 21.5 Ma (Odin & Kreuzer, 1988), i.e. a latest Aquitanian to mid-Burdigalian age. Vandenberghe et al. (2014) and Adriaens (2015) attribute the diverging age assessment to the presence of reworked glauconite pellets.",

            "lithological_description": "The Beerzel Member in the type area can be recognized by its yellow to white colour and low glauconite and clay content, and is consistently underlain by a more glauconite-rich unit – the Hallaar Member, and overlain by a unit with clay-sand alternations – the Heist-op-den-Berg Member. It has a homogeneous appearance, except for possible irregular brownish intercalations due to oxidation above the groundwater table, linked to groundwater fluctuations. Glauconite content is significantly lower in the Beerzel Member compared to the underlying Hallaar Member (2–6%, glauconite/quartz ratio of 0.02–0.08). The grain size distribution curves show a very well sorted sediment with a modal grain size between 185 and 204 µm and only a small amount of material outside of the 100 to 300 µm range. The content of dioctahedral 2:1 Al-rich layer silicates (3–9%, 2:1 Al-clay/quartz ratio of 0.03–0.11) is lower than in the Hallaar Member and similar to the sandy layers of the overlying Heist-op-den-Berg Member, and there is an overall decrease to the top. Feldspar content remains largely constant within the member (4–6%, feldspar/quartz ratio of 0.05– 0.08). On CPT’s, the Beerzel Member can be identified based on an interval with constant qc values, a bit higher than in the underlying and overlying members. Based on CPT profiles, the Beerzel Member also occurs further north, such as near Kasterlee, though not consistently (Vandenberghe et al., 2020).",

Smectite is the dominant clay mineral (Adriaens, 2015). The mode of the grain size within the formation varies between c. 130 μm and c. 330 μm (Verhaegen, 2020). The Berchem Formation holds a significant amount of epidote, amphiboles and garnet, making up on average more than 50% of the transparant heavy minerals (Verhaegen, 2020). Shells are abundantly present, dispersed or concentrated in massive layers. Parts of the formation, such as the Kiel Member, are locally decalcified. The Berchem Formation is on wireline log data typified by high gamma ray and moderate resistivity values (Deckers et al., 2019). A distinct gravel bed of dark, rounded flint pebbles is present at the base. The Berchem Formation holds four members: the Edegem Member, Kiel Member, Antwerpen Member and Zonderschot Member.",

It is expected that under the water table the sand may turn more greyish.

Probably the twofold nature of the geophysical signal of the Berg Sand Member in some borehole logs reflects the same lithological subdivision as observed in outcrops (Figures 8c,8d,10). At particular levels (Figure 10) occur sparse molluscs, a.o.

In a small area in the southeast of the basin, around Eghezée, central values in the order of 1 to 2 mm are found; this very coarse facies is also included in this Member. In some boreholes, a bed of similar very coarse sand is found at or near the base of the Formation, e.g. at Bierbeek and Scherpenheuvel. Such coarse, angular grains can be found admixed in the medium to coarse sand of the thick cross beds of this Member at some locations. Carbonate content (if not decalcified) is very low, below 2%, and consists of fossil remnants. This unit can have well, moderately or poorly sorted facies. A bipolar grain size distribution is often present in the sedimentary facies X. If a fraction of fine sand is present, a small admixture (much less than 2%) of very fine, light green glauconite pellets is always found. The Bierbeek Member may either contain a considerable admixture (from 5 to up to about 30%) of coarse dark green to blackish glauconite pellets (this tends to be the case in the east of the basin) or it can be devoid of such glauconite (in the west and southeast of the basin). The cementations have different shapes and sizes and are of the type with chalcedony to microquartz cement; also their content may vary. Very well-sorted beds tend to have low numbers of siliceous concretions; beds with mud laminae like in the bottomsets of cross-beds tend to have higher contents of siliceous concretions. Locally mud layers may be marly, but they are then often silicified. Because of the low original carbonate content, decalcification doesn’t alter the aspect of this unit much. Limonite cementations are only found in decalcified occurrences of the unit.",

It differs from the underlying Putte Member by its steadily increasing resistivity values on the geophysical log and by the prominent high resistivity values of the silt-enriched layers leading to marked wiggles on the curve. However the grain size of the Boeretang Member, expressed on a silt-sand-clay triangular diagram, is similar to the grain size of the Putte and Terhagen Members (see Vandenberghe et al., 2014 fig. 27 and Frederickx, 2019 fig. 35). The Boeretang Member silt layers that alternate with the clay layers can be well identified in cores. The pronounced expression on the geophysical logs of the silt and clay layers makes it possible to apply a coherent numbering of the silt beds and to correlate boreholes (Figure 2 and 12). The full Boeretang Member detailed lithological layering, including septaria horizons S180, S185, S190 and S200, was established by Mertens and Wouters (2003) (Figure 12 with codes under heading I).",

Because the layers within this silty top component can be well correlated on the basis of characteristic resistivity wiggles on logs, the interval has also been designated as 10-Wig package. Based on further subdivisions of the geophysical well log signals in the top of this silty Boom Clay, an informal system W0, W1, W2, W3 was applied in Vandenberghe et al. (2001).",

            "lithological_description": "An extensive synthesis on the Boom Clay geology is given in Vandenberghe et al. (2014). The Boom Clay is a grey silty clay or clayey silt with fairly constant chemical and mineralogical properties. Macroscopic fossil content is limited and mostly single shells of the mollusc Portlandia deshayesiana (in the literature also reported as Nuculana and Leda) are observed.. The ecological analysis of all observed fauna and flora in the clay proves the marine character of the clay deposit. The Boom Clay has been deposited in an open shelf sea under warm climatic conditions as a life-supporting mud at an approximate depth of about 100 m for the most clay-enriched parts, although the water depth fluctuated with several tens of meters due to eustatic variations during the full history of the clay sedimentation. The most silty horizons contain glauconite pellets. The clay contains a few percent of very early diagenetic, mm to cm and even dm scale concretionary pyrite that formed clearly associated with the presence of organic matter in the clay. Black staining of the clay is due to the presence of an increased amount of fine particles of land-derived plant remains. Small quantities of marine organic matter adsorbed on the clay minerals are always present. Marl horizons occur and typically large septaria concretions have developed in the most calcareous horizons. The septaria are an iconic property of the Boom Clay Formation (Septarienton in Germany). Detailed clay mineralogy of the Boom Clay can be found in Zeelmaekers et al. (2015).",

Instead of the former numerous brick yards with their own clay extraction pits, nowadays only two actively exploited large pits are active: the Wienerberger clay pit at Rumst and the Argex clay pit at Kruibeke-Burcht. Both clay pits are therefore the practical type sections at present. Many sections of former clay pits in the type area are documented in Vandenberghe (1978) and the cored and geophysical borehole at Reet (water tower) documents the Rupel cuesta section (Van Echelpoel, 1991 fig. 4.5; Vandenberghe et al., 2001 fig. 3).\nAs the upper part of the Boom Clay Formation is considerably eroded in the designated type area (Figures 4 and 5), a group of additional boreholes around Mol-Dessel in the Antwerp Campine (Mol SCK 15, ON-Mol-1 and ON-Dessel-1), is selected as reference boreholes to demonstrate the complete Boom Clay Formation section (Figures 2 and 12). The geophysical well logs of the three boreholes presented in Figure 2 are interpreted in terms of the 4 members of the Boom Clay Formation and a few key horizons. The link of the geophysical logs to the lithology section of the boreholes is easy as the same interpretation terms are figured on the lithology section of the same Mol-Dessel area in Figure 12 which is representing the most complete information extracted from cores and geophysical logging including core imaging. A correlation between the Reet borehole section in the outcrop area and the equivalent part in the Mol-Dessel area is shown in Figure 11."

Maximal thicknesses are observed in the Kinrooi (049W0230 /kb18d49w-B230) borehole: slightly more than 30 m for the lower clay unit and 20 m for the upper unit.

In between occurs the Pey Bed. The borehole is cored, sedimentological and mineralogical analyses are available as well as geophysical well logs and also palynological investigations are reported (Van der Sluys, 2000). The combination of marked high natural radioactivity and low resistivity signals allows a clear identification of the Brunssum Beds with respect to surrounding sand units.\nRegional profiles suggest the consistent existence in the area of at least two Brunssum Beds , labelled I and II  (Vandenberghe et al., 2005; Vernes et al., 2018 , annex D fig. 7.5 in which the same beds are labelled B1 and B2), while the profile presented by Dusar et al.

            "lithological_description": "The Bruyelle Member corresponds to the traditional “Dièves moyennes” and “Dièves supérieures”. In the type area it could be observed in temporary and partial outcrops along the TGV  line, especially West of Bruyelle village and in the overburden of abandoned limestone quarries in the Rieu de Barges SW of Tournai (Hennebert & Doremus, 1997a, b). It consists , from top to bottom of:\n– 5 – 10 m of whitish grey marl without silicifications;\n– 2 – 10 m of greenish grey marl, with phosphatic granules of upwards decreasing frequency and with fine to coarse glauconite grains;\n– max 1 m transgressive layer with varnish-green to brown (when phosphatised) pebbles are embedded in a greenish grey marl with coarse glauconite grains, locally very fossiliferous (rhynchonellids, terebratulids, oysters, …) of “Faux Tourtia” facies. This diachronous unit marks the base of the Turonian transgression.\nIn the area transitional to the Mons basin (Péruwelz, Hennebert, 1999a, b) the succession becomes more complete, allowing a threefold subdivision and comparable to the traditional French subdivision, from top to bottom:\n– chalky marl, white under dry conditions, with terebratulids, known as “Dièves supérieurs” or “Dièves bleues” in France;\n– greenish grey clayey marls, with Inoceramus labiatus, known as “Dièves moyennes” or “Dièves vertes” in France;\n– green to grey strongly clayey marls, known as “Dièves inférieures” or “Dièves multicolores” or “Assise de Saint-Aybert” in France, resting on a phosphatic pebble bed.\nIn the parastratotype area of the Flemish region observations are based on cores and geophysical well logs, allowing a less detailed but more consistent description. Cuttings (110W0007) consist of desintegrated bright green marly silt, becoming dark coloured and  more cohesive with depth; dispersed clasts of reddish brown clay; coarse quartz grains and mollusc shell debris increase with depth. The reddish brown clay bears some resemblance to the underlying Paleozoic strata which consist of violaceous shales. Top of the Frasnian shales has become slightly weathered but shows no signs of paleosol development (Tourneur et al., 1988). Mesofossils are characterized by a high frequency of foraminifers for an overall low number of bioclasts in the 1 – 2,4 mm mesh range (Felder, 1990, 1994). Cores (095W0153) display two subunits. The upper subunit consists of green silty marl, originally stratified but bioturbated, fossil-bearing (oyster shells, Inoceramus, sponge structures), displaying core dessication cracks, interbedded with ca 25 cm thick layers in bright green indurated silty chalk with poorly preserved mollusk shells, sponge structures, fish remains. The lower subunit displays thin lenses of calcarenitic glauconite-bearing chalk, partly silicified, interbedded with green marl, quickly becoming predominant and also more coarse-grained and richer in glauconite. Towards the base, but dispersed in the sediment, reworked pebbles of Cretaceous origin. Microfacies analysis from thin sections indicate an outer shelf depositional environment composed of bioclastic wackestone with foraminifers, calcispheres and molluscs (subunit 1 at 193.9 m) and bioclastic packstone with coarse glauconite grains and lithoclasts (subunit 2 at 216.1 and 217.6 m). Porosity values from image analysis attain 0,15% and 1.6% respecively (Lagrou et al., 2011). The natural gamma-ray log delineates these two subunits. The upper subunit (underneath a gamma-ray peak at the base of the upper member) is still of chalky-marly nature with rising gamma-ray readings towards the base, indicative for increasing glauconite content. The lower subunit is characterized by overall very high gamma-ray reading, indicative for clayey greensand. Therefore, the stratigraphic succession observed in boreholes in the Flemish region seems to confirm the subdivision in different units in the type area.",

            "lithological_description": "The clayey-top-facies consist of a glauconite-rich, poorly-sorted clayey sand with a characteristic higher clay content compared to the coarse Kempen Diest Member below. The size distribution mode typically ranges between 170 µm and 250 µm. The clay content (dispersed, less than 2µm) typically ranges between 1% and 10%. The pelletal glauconite content ranges between 26% and 67% and is on average 32.9% (Adriaens, 2015). \nThe mineralogical and clay mineralogical composition of the clayey-top-facies is very specific and differs from the rest of the Diest Formation. The clay mineralogy consists of a significant amount of expandable clay minerals: dioctahedral smectite but also, and more distinctly, trioctahedral Fe-rich vermiculite (see Adriaens & Vandenberghe, 2020 for details). This type of vermiculite is rare in the stratigraphic column, and is assumed to be related to a glauconitic soil environment. Most likely, it was not formed in-situ but originates from a remote source area where a soil developed on glauconitic sediment in very specific, yet poorly understood, conditions.\nApart from the distinct vermiculite, the clayey-top-facies is also relatively enriched in siderite, apatite and sporadically vivianite and chlorite but the relatively high clay content and the presence of Fe-vermiculite are the distinctive criteria for the clayey-top-facies.\nThis facies needs better descriptions of extent, correlations and depositional structures. Therefore, it is defined as a facies and not as a formal member inside the Diest Formation.",

Glauconite content averages 25%. In the vertical direction, grain size is either constant or coarsening upwards. The sand is most often homogenized by bioturbation. In cores, white burrow traces devoid of glauconite can be seen. No primary lamination is found in this member. The member was originally defined as the lowest part of the Diest Formation in the Kempen containing foraminifera and organic-walled microfossils (Laga & De Meuter, 1972). In practice however, the member has primarily been identified based on the grain-size criterion “modal grain size smaller than 200 µm”. This implies that also overlying fine-grained sand without carbonates is included in the member. The lowest, carbonaceous part is referred to as “lower Dessel Member” and the overlying, fine-grained sand without carbonates as “upper Dessel Member” (see annex 2 to Diest Formation sheet). The lower Dessel Member is not found systematically over the area of the Dessel Member.",

(2020) to be characterised as a complex of facies deposited in trough-shaped structures with intensely bioturbated foresets and remnants of bryozoan reefs in the lower part. The sediment consists of heterogenous glauconiferous fine-grained sand with a much lower number of fines (less than 125µm 15%), a larger amount of coarse grains (>250 µm 21–33%) and glauconite (39–49%) than that of the underlying Borsbeek Member. The color ranges from bluish-green to whitish-grey, depending on the amount of carbonate particles originating from the abrasion of the remains of the inhabitants of the bryozoan reefs that are incorporated in the sediment. Locally, the sediment is very fossiliferous, especially in the lower part. The macrofauna is generally small-sized, with bryozoans, serpulids (e.g. Ditrupa), decapod and cirripede crustaceans, bivalves and gastropods, echinoids and brachiopods. Terebratulids are locally abundant in the lower part and can be found both loose in the sediment as well as encased in sandstone. These terebratulids can also be encrusted by bryozoans. The brachiopod Cryptopora nysti is locally abundant. Shell fragments of lingulid brachiopods (Glottidia dumortieri) occur throughout. Trace fossils Macaronichnus segregatis, M. s. degiberti and Scolicia occur abundantly, and allow to ascribe the member to the Cruziana ichnofacies. Yellowish- to orange-colored clayey-limestone concretions and light-colored calcareous sandstone with bryozoans, terebratulids and small-sized mollusks in mold preservation are locally abundant above the basal gravel. The basal gravel generally contains small quartz and flint pebbles, reworked elasmobranch teeth, fish bones and fragments of marine mammal bones, and sometimes also larger sized concretions and bones that are reworked from the Borsbeek Member.",

According to King (2016), and based on De Meuter & Laga (1970), De Meuter (1974, 1980), King (1983) and Hooyberghs & Moorkens (2005), the presence of the Foraminifera Elphidium dopperti (Elphidium antoninum), Uvigerina pygmaea and Uvigerina venusta (hosiusi) deurnensis, together with the common presence of dextral Neogloboquadrina atlantica (‘Globigerina pachyderma’) are indicative of Zone NS40 of King (2016). The presence of Bolboforma metzmacheri, indicative of the Bolboforma metzmacheri Zone (De Meuter, 1974; Willems, 1976; Spiegler, 2001), allows to refine the latter positioning to King (2016)’s Subzone NS40b and to date it in the interval between 9.54 and 8.8 Ma (Goolaerts et al., 2020).",

Bosselaers et al. (2004) identified VII BR Borgerhout Rivierenhof described by De Meuter et al. (1967, fig. 2, Section A), De Meuter & Laga (1970, text-fig. 1) and De Meuter et al. (1976, fig. 17) as the most relevant of all the studied sections, and designated it as the stratotype. However, as discussed by Goolaerts et al. (2020), this proposed stratotype presents several shortcomings and the Middelares section of Bosselaers et al. (2004) could be a better stratotype section, but additional documentation for its microfossil content, namely dinoflagellates and Bolboforma is necessary."

Glauconite content varies from 25% to 60%. The coarse beds often contain a subpopulation of 0.5 to 2 mm (sub)angular quartz grains. In the vertical direction, grain size is either constant or coarsening upwards. The sand shows various primary structures: large and small-scale cross-bedding, massive sand, spaced planar lamination, displaying varying intensities of bioturbation. The cross-bedded facies may also contain isolated or bundled clay laminae. In the outcrop area, macrofossils are only known from a small number of localities, and they exist solely in the form of casts. In the shallow and deeper subsurface of the Antwerp and the Antwerp Campine areas, calcareous macro- and microfossils are locally abundant.\nThe subdivision of the Diest Formation into members still necessitates further study (Houthuys et al. 2020; Goolaerts et al., 2020). The present views lead to maintaining the Dessel Member and Deurne Member and introducing the Hageland Diest Member, Kempen Diest Member and the Borsbeek Member.\nThe local facies “clayey Diest” and “Bosbeek/Opoeteren” (see location in Vandenberghe & Louwye, 2020, Fig. 3, added in annex 2) need better descriptions of extent, correlations and depositional structures. Therefore, no formal members inside the Diest Formation are proposed for these facies now.",

The clay content is 4.7 ± 3.2% and the D90 of the grain size distribution is 284 ± 97 μm (De Meuter & Laga, 1976; Verhaegen, 2020). Large numbers of mollusks (Lucinoma borealis, Panopea meynardi, Pseudamussium lilli etc.) are dispersed throughout the sediment. The granulometry of the Edegem Member displays an upwards coarsening signature as observed in two locations in the Antwerp area (Bastin, 1966), corroborated by the log-interpretation of the Edegem Member in borehole Oelegem. The grain-size distribution curves of glauconite are similar to the quartz grain size distribution curve. This indicates that the glauconites of the Edegem Member are reworked and were transported together with the quartz grains (Adriaens, 2015; Adriaens & Vandenberghe, 2020). The glauconite content of the Edegem Member is smaller than in the Antwerpen Member (Adriaens, 2015), which explains the paler color of sediments of the former compared to the latter.",

Radiometric dating was carried out on glauconite grains from the Edegem Member (Odin & Kreuzer, 1988).

A marked paleoseismite horizon occurs in the middle of the Egem Member exposed in the Ampe/Egem pit (Crepin et al. ,2004). Towards the top, the sediment becomes coarser and more homogeneous with numerous nummulites. A detailed section of the Egem Member in the Ampe/Egem quarry and corresponding grain?size data (Geets, 1991) in the Tielt borehole 068E0169, are shown in Steurbaut (1998, p 117). Subdivisions of the Egem Member can be regionally followed in CPT logs and borehole descriptions (Jacobs et al., 1996a, b).

Lignite is generally dispersed, but can locally form about 3 m thick complexes as observed in the Sibelco sand pit in Opgrimbie (Gullentops, 1963, 1972-1973). Molluscs are generally lacking, but become apparent in the northernmost parts of occurrences, such as the Wijshagen and Molenbeersel boreholes (Deckers & Louwye, 2017). The Genk Member has a modal grain size of 172 ± 12 μm, a clay content of 2.1 ± 0.7% and a D90 of 411 ± 274 μm, based on a small amount of samples (Verhaegen, 2020). One of those samples has a second coarse mode of 623 μm explaining also the large variation in D90. The colour of the sand is yellowish in the east Brabant area, brownish to yellowish in the subsurface in the Hasselt area and becomes white in the easternmost part of Limburg (Opgrimbie Facies).",

They always contain high quantities ofquartzosesilt and, locally, lignified wood, often pyritized. The sands and conglomerates are well represented at the top of the clay levels at Hautrage. They form an extensive torrential delta at Thieu (former St-Pierre quarry). Several formations may be recognised, ignoring the order of deposition:\n– Sainte-Barbe Clays Formation (SBA): grey, sandy, lignitic and highly fossiliferous clays, filling a sinkhole.\n–  Hautrage Clays Formation (HAU): silto-quartzose,grey, white, reddish, black clays with intercalations of sandy,siltyand lignito-pyritic beds.\n– Baudour Clays Formation (BAD): grey siltyand variegated clays.\n– Saint-Pierre Gravel Formation (SPR): coarse- and fine-grained white sands, gravel, eroded pebbles, conglomerates, silty beds, torrential and deltaic deposits with cross-bedded stratification.\nLocally, only continental faunas and floras have been collected from fossiliferous deposits.",

The lateral geometrical relationship between the two sandy Members had already been noticed in the classical lithostratigraphic paper by Steurbaut & Nolf (1986), in which the Mont?Panisel Member was indicated as Panisel Sand. The relationship between the sand members has been interpreted in sequence stratigraphic reconstructions (Vandenberghe et al., 1998, 2004; Steurbaut, 2011). The introduction of the Hyon Formation arranges the position of the strata in the hills of Bois?la?Haut and Mont?Panisel, located in the village of Hyon southeast of Mons (map figure 1 in Steurbaut & King, 1994), and which are at the origin of the former classic but now obsolete Paniselian stage (Steurbaut, 2006). The problematic geometric position of the Panisel sand in Brabant and in outliers in the Hainaut area, as it was demonstrated in Steurbaut & Nolf (1986), has been solved by the introduction of the Hyon Formation.",

The name Jagersborg Sand has been introduced by Vanhoorne et al. (1999) for white quartz sand underlying the Meuse gravel in the area. Nevertheless, the map authors recognise that possibly part of the sand unit could be the Early Pleistocene fluviatile Kedichem Formation (nowadays included in the Waalre Formation (Westerhoff, 2009, p16) on top of the Jagersborg Sand as also interpreted by Van der Sluys (2000). In a regional profile (Vandenberghe et al., 2005, fig.10) all except the Maaseik (049W0220) boreholes have the Stramproy Formation sand overlying the Jagersborg/Schinveld unit. The Stramproy Formation is deposited by rivers that drained the Belgian area in contrast to the  about time-equivalent mixed Meuse-Rhine river deposits of the Waalre Formation; the former is characterised by dominantly stable heavy minerals and the latter by unstable heavy minerals ( Westerhoff, 2009, p 16). In the present practice also more clayey layers are included and a gradual transition to the Kieseloolite Formation is reported (TNO-GDN, 2021) explaining why in the H3O report (Vernes et al., 2018) the Stramproy Formation is also interpreted in the Maaseik (049W0220) borehole between 22 and 63.2 m depth.",

Dusar et al (2014) have split the Jagersborg Member in an inferior and superior part, the lower part containing more clay than the upper sandy part. The boundary between the two subunits occurs at 63.2 m in the Maaseik borehole. In the H30 report (Vernes et al., 2018) the upper Jagersborg is part of the Stramproy Formation and the lower Jagersborg is part of the Kieseloolite Formation."

The sand has been described as clayey at the base and fining towards the top. Occasional layers of Glycymeris obovata (Lamarck, 1819) shells and marine shell imprints have been described in the upper part. Other characteristic species are Arctica islandica rotundata (Agassiz, 1845), Pycnodonte queteleti (Nyst,1853), Hilberia hoeninghausi (Defrance, 1825) (Vervoenen, 1995; Baut & Génault, 1999). Except for some reworked foraminifera, no microfauna has been observed. Small lignite fragments are occasionally present. In Limburg the gravel in the middle of the sand unit is reported to be well developed and consists of rounded quartz and flint pebbles (from Van den Broeck 1893 p 285, 280; Gulinck, 1954; Batjes, 1958; Kruissink et al., 1978; Claes et al., 2001; Claes & Gullentops, 2001). As the Kerniel Sand Member is seldom exposed, the Gellik-Eigenbilzen Albert Canal section in the early 90s of the previous century is an exceptional outcrop worth mentioning. The section was studied for fossils by Vervoenen (1995) and Baut & Génault (1999). Remarkably in the middle of the 9-10 m thick sand section the last authors describe a dm thick shell grit layer (op.cit. fig.4) with a wavy eroding base (op.cit. fig.3) containing fish and other vertebrate remains and also small white quartz pebbles, undoubtedly the same level described by Steurbaut et al. (1999) with channels, gravel and oblique lamination. This observation seems to fit the subdivision in three units labelled R1d, R2a, R2b by Van den Broeck (1893) as discussed above.",

The reason is that within the Rupelian stage (R), two assises were distinguished (R1 & R2); within each of these marine cycles or assises a theoretical sedimentary cycle was assumed with successive facies a (gravel), b (transgressive sand), c (deeper marine clay) and d (regressive sand) (Rutot, 1883). As the Kerniel Sand at Kerniel near Borgloon (Looz) interpreted by Van den Broeck (1893 p. 270) as a stratigraphically independent sand unit between two deeper marine clay units, the argile à Nucula comta (Kleine Spouwen Member) and the argile à Leda Deshayesiana (Boom Formation), this intermediate Kerniel Sand unit needs to be composed of a succession of regressive sand, a base gravel and an overlying transgressive sand, labelled respectively as R1d, R2a and R2b. In the Stratigraphic Register (Anonymous, 1929,1932) the sand unit corresponding to the Kerniel Sand is not listed. On the recent 1: 50 000 geological maps the coding for the Kerniel Sand is BiKe.",

The clay content is 2.5 ± 1.3% and the D90 of the grain size distribution of 404 ± 108 μm, making the Kiel Member less clayey and with a larger coarse fraction compared to the underlying Edegem Member and overlying Antwerpen Member (De Meuter & Laga, 1976; Verhaegen, 2020). This facies occurs in the south and central part of the city of Antwerp (De Meuter & Laga, 1976). To the north and east of Antwerp this member becomes fossiliferous (Everaert et al., 2020). Everaert et al. (2020) studied several temporary outcrops of the Kiel Member in Antwerp and could distinguish the fossiliferous Kiel and Antwerpen members by a slight but marked color difference (greyish versus blackish) due to a somewhat lower clay and glauconite content and a coarser sand fraction in the Kiel Member. The glauconite content ranges from 28% to 54% and is on average 38% (Adriaens, 2015). The Kiel Member is characterized by a different ichnofacies, with the almost continuous presence of bioturbation. Everaert et al. (2020) described furthermore in great detail sandstone layers and shell layers (Glycymeris, Cordiopsis, Cyrtodaria), intercalated between several metres of loose grey sand, seemingly devoid of calcareous fossils. In contrast to the Antwerpen Member, the recorded molluscs are worn and very fragile due to heavy decalcification.",

            "lithological_description": "A grey silty clay unit with sandy layers of several dm thickness have been observed near the base. The presence of silt and sand is distributed in layers of cm to dm. Several subunits can be distinguished as proposed by Jacobs et al. (1996a, b) and Steurbaut (1998). The Kortemark Member occurs between heavy clay units: the Aalbeke Member below and the Egemkapel Member above. The maximal thickness is about 25 m (Geets et al., 2000). In the top of the underlying Aalbeke Member a gradual coarsening upwards occurs, ended by a sharp coarsening that marks the start of coarser sediments in the Kortemark Member (see analyses from Geets (1991) and interpreted in Steurbaut (1998)). In geophysical log patterns the start of the coarsening upwards interval in the Aalbeke Mbr above its very clay?rich main part, as well as the sharp coarse shift at the top of the coarsening upwards part of the Aalbeke Mbr which marks the position of a fine sand layer, can be observed fairly consistently (e.g. Torhout 052E0195, Tielt 053E0061, Gent 55W1020, On?Kallo 1 014E0355). The formal boundary between the Aalbeke and Kortemark Members is drawn at the position of the major grain?size shift and the income of the first fine?sand layer (correlation profiles in Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire, 2009). This boundary definition at the base of the lowest fine?sand layer has the advantage to correspond to an observable horizon with water outflow in the upper part of the Desimpel clay pit in Kortemark (Steurbaut, 1998, Fig.5). Detailed lithological analyses of the Kortemark Member sections in the Tielt borehole 068E0169 and the Kortemark and Egem extraction pits, are figured in Geets (1991) and Steurbaut (1998, p 117). Details in the geophysical well log signature in the Kortemark Member can be correlated between wells, especially the significant higher values of the resistivity, standing for more sandy layers, can be correlated between the different logs.",

It is also known towards the east and northeast of Flanders (Antwerp Province) where it becomes thinner. In the southeast of East Flanders and the neighbouring eastern Brabant provinces, the Mont?Panisel Member overlies the Aalbeke clay Member in Kerksken (086E0340) and Kattem (087W0479) (Geological Service Company, 2003), implying the disappearance towards the east of the Kortemark Member and the Egemkapel Member (see also Mont?Panisel Member). Also on the map sheet 23 Mechelen, Buffel et al. (2009) note that the Kortemark Member disappears to the east and is only present in the western part of the map. In the 1:40 000 geological map legend the Kortemark Member is included in the Yc unit and in the Stratigraphic Register of the Conseil Géologique(1929) and the Aardkundige Raad (1932) in the Y1a division. In the Bolle & Jacobs (1993) nomenclature the unit Yd1c unit is tentatively correlated to the Kortemark Member. In the present review the Yd2 unit of these authors, a 5 m densily packed fine glauconitic sand underlying the Egemkapel clay Member, is also included in the Kortemark Member, notwithstanding its resemblance to the Egem Sand above.

However, in?the-present?text the base of Kortemark has been replaced at a level in the Kortemark Desimpel quarry corresponding to the level at 48 m depth in the Tielt borehole according to the log interpretation Tielt 053E0061 in the compendium. Indeed because the top of the Aalbeke Member gradually becomes siltier upwards (see analyses in Steurbaut, 1998 fig. 5) it has been argued in?the?present?synthesis that the first marked sandy layer in the Desimpel clay pit in Kortemark (marked as  sharp junction waterflow at the base of subunit C in Steurbaut 1998 p 117) (map sheet 20/3?4 Kortemark?Torhout, x= 57.050,y= 190.400, z= +16m) is a more easily recognisable lithostratigraphical horizon to mark the base of the Kortemark Member. In the present review this level is chosen as the formal boundary between the Aalbeke and Kortemark Members (see discussion in Description above). The top of the Kortemark Member has during many years (80s and 90s) been exposed in the classical Egem extraction pit  053W0060 (map sheet 21/1, x= 70.150, y= 190.150) as an erosive contact with the overlying Egemkapel (see Steurbaut, 1998, p 117)."

In regional sections, the Kwatrecht Member is geometrically positioned between the Egem and Merelbeke Members by Steurbaut & Nolf (1986), Steurbaut (1991) and Willems & Moorkens (1991). Based on geometry and biostratigraphy the Kwatrecht Member has been related to the Hyon Formation by Vandenberghe et al. (2004). However more recently the Kwatrecht Complex is ranged in the Gentbrugge Formation by Steurbaut (2006, 2011).",

They were selected as the type section for the Kasterlee Formation in the Lithostratigraphic scale of Belgium (2001) although the lower part of the formation was never exposed in the hill ridge. These outcrops in fact show the southern glauconite-poor Hoge Berg Facies.\nSeveral boreholes in the Turnhout area contain reference data on the Lichtaart Member, where the northern glauconite-rich Oud-Turnhout Facies is present. The reference section selected for the Lichtaart Member is in the Rees borehole (017E0399; kb8d17e-B495). The full section described as Kasterlee Formation between 25 and 33,5 m is interpreted as the Lichtaart Member. Cores, sediment analyses and dinoflagellate cyst analyses are available in this interval (Buffel et al., 2001; Vandenberghe et al., 2020). The Kasterlee Formation  in the Gierle borehole (017W0158 ; Kb8d17w-B14) between 26 and 34 m is also identified as the Lichtaart Member and has detailed grain-size analyses (Gullentops and Huyghebaert, 1999).  Although the base of the Lichtaart Member is not reached in the Oud-Turnhout  borehole (017E 0401;kb817e-B497), a section of about 11 m of the Lichtaart Member between 39 and 50 m with sediment analyses is juxtaposed to a gamma-ray log of the similar interval in the nearby Turnhout borehole (017E0398; kb8d17e-B294) in Louwye et al.

A gradual decrease of the clay and shells occurs in the upper part of the formation. Locally, the uppermost part can be decalcified. Glauconite content is fairly constant and varies between 6 and 12% with locally some higher content up to 20% in the basal part (Luchtbal Member; Laga, 1972).  The formation was subdivided by De Meuter & Laga (1976), from base to top, into the Luchtbal Member, the Oorderen Member, the Kruisschans Member, the Merksem Member and the Zandvliet Member. Now, the Poederlee Member (former formation) and the Broechem Bed (new) are also included in the Lillo Formation. De Meuter & Laga (1976) stressed the fact that whereas only the lower Luchtbal Member has distinct boundaries, a gradual change is observed between all other members.",

This section can be correlated to the nearby type CPT (DOV GEO-20/034-S5) which shows high cone resistance (20-40 MPa) and low friction ratio (1%) at the sandy units and low cone resistance (10 MPa) and higher friction ratio (> 2%) at the clayey central unit of the Lillo Formation.  Type geophysical borehole is borehole Stabroek (GSB: 015W0216; DOV kb7d15w-B296) with the Lillo Formation between 4 to 36 m depth (modified after Laga, 1979; Fig. 2)."

Original observations were made in former extraction sites of the lignite that was used as heating resource in the Mol area, and also in the now no longer exploited De Maat sand pit where the bed was 1-2,5 m thick. Wood fragments were stacked in the lignite bed and flattened tree stems of several meter length occurred in it (Gullentops and Vandenberghe, 1995a). In the subsurface, the bed was mapped within the Mol sand by Gulinck (1962, fig.3). In geophysical borehole logs the bed is well expressed by an elevated gamma-ray signal. The Maat Lignite Bed was chosen to subdivide within the Mol Formation the Maatheide Member above it and the Donk Member below it (Gullentops and Vandenberghe, 1995a).",

            "lithological_description": "Very fine to fine sand. The central grain size value (mode or median) is finer than 150-175 ?m. The Member contains a subdominant admixture (much less than 2%) of very fine, light green glauconite pellets. In its original appearance (i.e., not decalcified), the sand is white to pale yellow, the carbonate content is higher than 15% and consists of fine mud. Carbonate content may locally reach high values, even exceeding 50%. The sand is fully or partially bioturbated and may contain very fine to cm-scale marly mud laminae. Macrofossils may be present. In flush wells, this facies is easily recognized by the white colour of the flushing fluid. In outcrop, it is easily recognized by the fact that on touching the fingers are stained white.In this Member, subhorizontal, ca. 1 to 2 dm thick stone beds, cemented by carbonate and by some opal (Fobe, 1986), are common. The stone beds have a high total carbonate content, even up to 80%, that occurs as cement, as marly laminations, as fossils and as rounded bioclast grains that are mixed with the quartz grains (Dusar et al., 2009, p. 242 & 330). When they occur, often several such subhorizontal sandstone beds are found over the vertical profile, separated by 0.5 to 1 m of uncemented sand. These carbonate sandstones have in the past been used as building stones (ann. 2). At the historic type locality, Brussels and its immediate surroundings, this unit is predominantly found near the top of the Formation (Dumont, 1839; Rutot & Van den Broeck, 1883). In the area NE of Brussels, the sandstone is called “Diegem sandstone”, in the area between Tienen and Jodoigne, the “Gobertange sandstone” is found, while in the wide area around Braine-l’Alleud and Nivelles, a similar stone called “grès calcareux du Bruxellien” (the name of “central Brabant sandstone” is proposed here) occurs. The Diegem sandstone mostly represents stone from the Brussels Formation but also partially from the Lede Formation sandstone, where it is found on top of the Brussels Formation. The stone layers in both formations have a similar aspect but Lede stones have less well sorted quartz grains, may contain 1-2 mm quartz grains and have more varied fossil remains. The Gobertange sandstone has in the 19th and first half of the 20th century been quarried and exported as building stone on an almost industrial scale (Tordoir, 2000). This stone is characterized by very thin white marl laminae perforated by burrows, filled with glauconite-rich medium to coarse sand. South and southeast of Brussels, in the wide area around Braine-l’Alleud and Nivelles, and locally around Grez-Doiceau (ann. 2), carbonate sandstones are found, which have an aspect very similar to the Diegem sandstone though in this area some layers attain a thickness of over 3 dm and the proportion of medium sand may be higher. Local variants may be found, e.g. finely laminated calcareous sandstone at Rood Klooster/Rouge Cloître (Oudergem/Auderghem). Capriciously shaped, hard, often small (at most 1 dm) siliceous concretions (“grès fistuleux” and “pierres de grottes”) are frequent in this facies; in fact, their presence is a diagnostic for separating it from surrounding, similar strata such as the Lede Formation. In calcareous facies, the siliceous concretions may contain carbonate elements. The Member is often decalcified. Decalcification caused a change in colour: it is yellowish or greenish brown due to the fact that non soluble grains such as fine-grained glauconite are concentrated and grains are limonite coated. Decalcification is found only in the outcrop area and there tends to occur primarily near the flanks of the valleys (geomorphology) and near the surface (vadose zone). Decalcification fronts are generally very sharp and may form capricious surfaces. Decalcification is caused by dissolution of carbonates in permeating water. The process is recent (related to the present landscape evolution) and is still ongoing.As it is decalcified, the facies no longer contains carbonate cemented sandstones and the chalcedony cemented concretions have turned brittle. In outcrop, the occurrence of capricious brittle siliceous sandstones or ghosts provides a good diagnostic. An important consequence of this superficial weathering is that the sand becomes undercompacted and loses nearly all compressional strength. The alteration depth is in the metric scale but may exceed 10 m and its distribution is erratic. Recording the alteration is of great importance for geotechnical applications.",

Thin sand laminae with organic matter and small pyritic concretions have been described by De Moor & Geets (1974). The Merelbeke Member thickness is generally limited to about 6 to 7 m but exceptionally up to 14 m near Melle in the profile 3 by De Moor & Geets (1973). The thickness variations as figured in the profile by De Moor and Geets (1973) are most probably due to the lack of borehole sample quality although they may also be the result of strong erosion at that stratigraphic interval (Vandenberghe et al. 2004).",

In the stratigraphic register (1929, 1932) it is part of the Y2 division. In the 1:40 000 mapping, Merelbeke and Aalbeke Members have been confused in the southwest of Flanders. In the area west of Mechelen (Hombeek, Zemst…), the Merelbeke Member has been confused in some borehole descriptions with the P1n clay (1:40.000 map legend), which is a unit occurring above or in the top of the Vlierzele Member (Buffel et al., 2009).

            "lithological_description": "The Merlin Member corresponds to the traditional “Fortes Toises”. In the type area it could be observed in temporary and partial outcrops along the TGV line (Hennebert & Doremus, 1997a, b). It consists, from top to bottom of:\n– white chalky marl, with grey silicified concretions;\n– grey-white marl with greenish shine, with fine glauconite.\nIn the area transitional to the Mons basin (Péruwelz, Hennebert, 1999a, b) the member is not subdivided in successive units but consists of grey marls to grey-white marly chalk with dull partly silicified concretions (“chailles”), better corresponding to the original definition as “Fortes Toises”. In the parastratotype area of the Flemish region observations are based on cores and geophysical well logs, allowing a less detailed but more consistent description. Cuttings (95W0153) consist of bright green silty marl in the upper part, mixed with fine glauconitic sand in the lower part. The core consists from top to bottom of light greenish chalk with oxidised specks of iron sulfide, turning into green silty chalk with clay laminations containing shell debris, with a basal layer of white very coarse-grained and porous chalk. The gamma-ray log allows to recognize two sequences in the Merlin Member, delineated by beds which show an increase of the gamma ray readings; these probably correspond to the more sandy glauconiferous base of a fining upwards sequence, grading into white chalks. Overall a steady increase in gamma ray level is observed from top to bottom of the Vert Galand Formation. Although the stratigraphic succession observed in boreholes in the Flemish region may be deposited in a more distal part of the sedimentary basin compared to the Tournaisis and does not show the silicifications (which are observed at a higher level and included in the overlying stratigraphic unit) it seems to confirm the subdivision in two units in the type area.",

            "lithological_description": "White to pale yellow, when glauconiferous greenish yellow, medium sand. The grain size central value is comprised between a lower value range of 150 to 175 ?m and an upper value range of 250 to 300 ?m. The carbonate content (if not decalcified) is between 2 and 15%; most of this is fine mud. Micro- and macrofossils are often present. Commonly, the sand is moderately sorted and a fraction of fine sand is present. In that case, always a small admixture (much less than 2%) of very fine, light green glauconite pellets is found. This unit has low to medium dark glauconite content facies. In certain areas, a gradually increasing admixture of coarser, dark green to blackish coloured glauconite pellets has been observed (ann. 1). The dominant primary sedimentary structure is parallel master bedding, inclined at a small angle and dipping to ESE. The master beds show a gradually decreasing slope near the bottom of the Formation. Thin and thicker, up to 1 m thick, cross beds occur and are incorporated in the master fill style. Sometimes they constitute stacks of cross beds. The cross beds have a (very) dominant foreset dip to NNE, with rare occurrences of dips to SSW, and numerous mud drapes testifying to tidal currents. In numerous outcrops, the sand is strongly homogenized due to bioturbation. Between the opposites of relatively non-bioturbated cross beds and completely homogenized beds, all possible grades of increasing bioturbation occur. Locally, faintly wavy to structureless bedding is present in sharply bounded packages. In most cases, numerous siliceous concretions are present, varying from capriciously shaped “grès fistuleux” (including “pierres de grottes”) to slab-shaped “grès lustrés”. They tend to be very hard and make drilling and excavating difficult. In structureless facies, siliceous stones are rare and often spherical, to absent. No carbonate stone beds occur. In places where this Member has been decalcified, the Member remains identifiable by its grain size. Decalcification brings about a change in colour: it has turned yellow, brownish yellow or greenish brown due to the fact that non soluble grains such as glauconite are concentrated and grains are limonite coated. Often, local limonite cementation has occurred during or following decalcification. Decalcification is found only in the outcrop area and in this case tends to occur primarily near the flanks of the valleys (geomorphology) and near the surface (vadose zone). Decalcification fronts are generally sharp and may form capricious surfaces. In the decalcified facies of the Unit, the chalcedony cemented concretions have turned more or less brittle.",

The gravel was first observed during the construction works for an additional sluice on the Albert Canal at Olen, in 1972. It was briefly mentioned in Louwye et al. (2007) as “the presence of coarser quartz grains, occasional round stones and even a silicified shell fragment”. It was later also identified to the south in the Beerzel and Heist-op-den-Berg Hills and described in detail by Verhaegen et al. (2014). The gravel occurs diffusely in the sediment of the Hallaar Member and can be best recognized by sieving a sample over a 1 mm screen. Flattened and elongated flint pebbles with a length up to 4 cm occur. The pebbles have a characteristic spotted patina. Many coarse (> 1 mm) quartz grains occur, which are mostly angular but larger rounded grains are present as well. A third component are white powdery fragments of weathered silex, which are markedly larger (> 1 cm) in the Olen outcrop. Lastly, iron crust fragments up to 1.5 cm with rounded edges occur as well.",

On the nearby CPT (DOV GEO-20/034-S5), the Oorderen Member is characterised by relatively uniform friction ratios (between 1 and 2%) and cone resistance values of on average around 30 MPa.

The Orchies Member is overlain by more sandy or silty clay deposits of the Roubaix Member or Mons?en?Pévèle Formation. The thickness can be up to 40 m. A pebble layer has been reported occasionally at its base (Ya on the 1:40 000 geological maps). Whereas in the visual description of macroscopic samples, even from cores, it is very hard to see any further lithological subdivision of the Orchies Member, the geophysical log signatures (see reference boreholes in compendium) do show a systematic variability interpreted as grain?size and mineralogical variations. The top of the very high gamma?ray section at the base of the Orchies Member, about 10 to 15 m thick, is a correlatable surface (see also further Geophysical logs and Subdivisions). It corresponds to the top of the mistakenly named Mont?Héribu Member (KoMh) unit in the correlation figures in Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009 figs 12,14,16,18, 20, 22, 24) and approximately to the level 1 in the plates in Vandenberghe et al. 1991). The top of the Orchies clay Member/ base Roubaix Member or base Mons-en?Pévèle Formation, is defined by the top of the very clay?enriched sediment. This level could be identified with confidence in descriptions of a series of destructive boreholes by G. De Geyter (1990, Archives Belgian Geological Survey) as the transition from silty clay above to heavy clay below. (courtesy Marleen De Ceukelaire).",

            "area_of_occurrence": "The Orchies Member consistently occurs where the Ieper Group occurs in Belgium. In the Hainaut area thickness is between 10?16m whilst in central Flanders and north Belgium thickness can be over 40 m. Towards the east in Brabant its thickness is reduced to a few meters. Originally the name was introduced by Gosselet (1874, p 611) to indicate the compact and stiff clays at the base of what is now known as the Ieper Group sediments; later, as a refinement of the lithostratigraphy, the sandy and silty Mont?Héribu Member at its base was individualised as a separate unit and the name Orchies Member was reserved for the compact heavy clays above the Mont?Héribu Member (Steurbaut, 1998). The later introduced name Saint?Maur Member (Belgian stratotype area, Geets, 1988; Maréchal, 1993), used in the legend of the 1:50 000 mapping in Flanders is a synonym of the Orchies Member although it (Saint?Maur unit) was generally used in a more restrictive way, because the lower part of the Orchies Member was erroneously assigned to the Mont Héribu Member; it is preferred to maintain the original name Orchies, a small locality to the southeast of Roubaix in Northern France. On maps 1:25 000 of the Brabant Wallon (Nivelles?Genappe, Braine?le?Comte?Féluy) the Formation de Carnières is used for a unit close to Orchies. On the legend of the geological maps 1:40 000 the Orchies Member was included in the Yc clayey deposits and in the stratigraphic register (1929,1932) in the Y1a. The argilite de Morlanwelz is a lateral equivalent of the Orchies Member (Steurbaut, 1991). The Wardrecques and Bailleul members are reported in King (1991). The lower part of the Wardrecques member belongs to the Orchies Member whilst the upper part and the Bailleul member corresponds to the Roubaix Member (King, 1991). This subdivision is not commonly used in the literature but the position of Wardrecques and Bailleul members is well documented in boreholes of the Moeskroen?Kortrijk?Marke?Ooigem area by King (1991, fig. 11). In this area at least 5 glauconiferous beds occur, each less than 15 cm thick (King, 1991).",

Ortlieb & Chelloneix (1870, p25) had already used the name Argile de Wahagnies to indicate the Orchies Member compact clays (Steurbaut, 1998). In the clay pit, the base is defined by the basal pebble bed below about 8 m of stiff clays. Coordinates: X = 649.250, Y = 310.600, Z = +50 m. The upper boundary, marking the limit with the overlying Roubaix Member, is proposed in the Kallo well 027E0148 (Gulinck, 1969) at 341m depth (Steurbaut, 1998, p 112) (see also below)."

Bioturbation is common. Tidal gullies have been reported by Geets et al. (2000). The thickness of the Pittem Member is about 15 to 20 m. Traces of lignite have been reported in the Pittem Member occurring between Knokke and Kruibeke in the north of West and East Flanders by Fobe (1993). The lower boundary is easily distinguished from either the underlying Merelbeke Member, the Egem Sandstone Bed or the Egem Member. The often reported gradual transition between Pittem Member and the overlying Vlierzele unit in boreholes, is erroneous and due to a confusion between the Pittem Member and clayey parts of the Vlierzele unit sensu Fobe (1995) (Fobe, 1995 p 143). Also, in typical cases, the limit between the clayey sediment of the Pittem Member and the overlying Vlierzele Sand can be traced with reasonable confidence in the geophysical log correlation profiles by Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009). Fobe (1997) reports that in the subsurface of northwest Belgium the upper part of the Pittem Member is a conspicuous horizon, brown coloured by lignitic material.",

            "lithological_description": "The Poppel sand has been described in a flushed borehole Weelde (BGD 008E0133; DOV kb8d8e-B26) by Laga & Notebaert (1981). An interval of 31 m between 102 and 133 m deep is described as poorly glauconitic fine clayey and also carbonate containing homogeneous sand. This sand interval has a characteristic gamma-ray profile: a cyclic evolution with a middle very low gamma-ray signal; the resistivity values increase upwards but above the middle part of the interval resistivities remain high in two lobes. (Figure 36 1). The stratigraphic interpretation is unsure. Laga & Notebaert (1981) have opted to consider the sand as a glauconite poor part of the underlying Diest Formation. The sand above was interpreted by these authors as the Kattendijk Formation. However on regional profiles drawn in the mid and late 1970s by Laga for the Groundwater Commission of the Province of Antwerp (Archives of the Geological Survey of Belgium), the Poppel Facies obviously is not yet indicated as it was not yet described, but on the profiles PGL/76/106/3 (Poppel-Ravels-Turnhout) and PGL 76/106/2 (Poppel-Ravels-Dessel) (Laga, 1976), this Poppel Facies would geometrically have been included in about 45 m of fine glauconitic sand interpreted as Kasterlee Formation sand below the Lillo Formation with shell debris and overlying the Diest Formation (Vandenberghe et al. , 2020 figs 7a&b). Nevertheless, the presence of carbonates in the sand is not in line with either the classical Kasterlee Formation or the Diest Formation. Another complicating factor is that the geometrical relay of Kattendijk Sand in the west by Kasterlee Sand in the east is shown to occur in the Weelde area on profile PGL/74/105 (Laga, 1976). Given the carbonate content of the Poppel Facies a lateral correlation of this unit with the carbonate containing Kattendijk Formation is plausible. Based on log correlations between Belgium and the Netherlands in the northwestern Campine area (Vernes et al., 2023), the Poppel Facies may be correlated with the Goirle Member of the Oosterhout Formation (see Fig. 35.2). The overlying Kattendijk Formation is the lateral equivalent of the Tilburg Member of the Oosterhout Formation, while the underlying Diest Formation can be correlated with the Diessen Formation. Based on this correlation, a position of the Poppel Facies as a basal unit of the Kattendijk Formation in the Voorkempen area may be proposed. More data are required before the interval can be given its definitive stratigraphic position.",

The Putte Member consists of an alternation of silt-enriched and clay-enriched layers, several dm thick up to over a meter near its top (Vandenberghe & Mertens, 2013). Also the Terhagen Member is layered but in contrast to it, the Putte Member additionally has black stained layers of a few dm at the basis of the clay-enriched layers (Figures 13 and 16). Therefore the Putte Member can be described as a dark grey clay in contrast to the paler grey Terhagen Member (Vandenberghe et al. 2014 fig.10; Vandenberghe, 1978, photo 6, p. 33). Characteristic beds in the Putte Clay are the 2 DB silty beds (Figures 17, 18), the platy septaria bed S50 and the sideritic septaria horizon S60 (Figure 12). From its base to about level S50, the Putte Clay has the thinnest layers of the Boom Clay Formation (Vandenberghe & Mertens, 2013). These features can be particularly well observed in the outcrop area (Figures 13, 16, 17, 18). However in the outcrop area the upper part of the Putte Member is significantly eroded compared to its more complete development in the subsurface. The Putte Clay Member in the subsurface keeps a fairly constant average gamma-ray and resistivity signal across the small wiggles which reflect the alternating silt-enriched and clay-enriched layers. This constant geophysical  signal is in contrast with the overlying Boeretang Member of which the resistivity starts to markedly increase upwards, across the wiggles pointing to a much larger silt content than the underlying Putte Member (Figure 2).",

As along the cuesta since some time the exploitation is limited to the Wienerberger clay pit at Rumst and the exploitation has changed from bucket bagger extraction to dragline excavating, also the Argex clay extraction pit at Kruibeke-Burcht can serve as reference section. Remark that the Putte Clay Member in the outcrop area is always eroded and incomplete. Therefore boreholes with cores and geophysical logs have also to be considered for reference to the complete Putte Member such as the Mol-Dessel area borehole sections and geophysical logs (Figure 2)."

The Rees Facies could be considered as a westward evolution of the Mol Formation’s Donk Member to the Merksplas Formation; compared to the Donk Member the Rees Facies contains some more glauconite grains and muscovite flakes but it is less heterogeneous compared to the Merkpslas Formation (see LIS Merksplas Formation).",

The Rees Facies was mapped on the 8/2 Turnhout Meerle geological map (Buffel et al., 2002) as part of the Mol Formation (see above). To the west of the Rees Facies occur the Schorvoort, Hemeldonk and Malle facies discussed in Buffel et al. (2001) and mapped as Brasschaat Formation on the 8/2 Turnhout Meerle geological map (Buffel et al., 2002).  To the north in the subsurface of the Antwerp province, the identification of the Brasschaat Formation in general is not obvious (Laga, 1976 –profile PGL76/106/3) . In the Geologica Belgica Neogene Volume 2020 (Louwye et al.

            "lithological_description": "The Retie Member is a fine-grained pale grey sand unit, with a median grain size around 180 µm and only trace amounts of dispersed glauconite pellets, that occurs underneath the Donk Sand Member of the Mol Formation. At the top of the Retie Member drilling mud is reported to start colouring slightly green, obviously on the condition that at the start clear water is used to make up the drilling fluid. By colour, the Retie Member can hardly be distinguished in boreholes from the overlying Donk Member. In the Retie-Geel-Kasterlee area only a notable size fraction >250 µm in the Donk Formation allows to detect the boundary between both members. Eastwards, in the Mol-Dessel area the grain size of the the Donk Member becomes coarser and the boundary with the underlying Retie Member is clear (Vandenberghe et al., 2020, fig.2). In the Poppel-Rauw Fault area and eastwards of it, a relatively thin but marked high gamma-ray clayey bed occurs on top of the Retie Member sand that is named informally the ‘level 3 clay’ bed and on top of which the drilling mud starts to become green. Below the Retie Member occurs the much more clayey Heist-op-den-Berg Member of the Kasterlee Formation in the Retie-Geel-Kasterlee-Dessel area and the boundary is marked by a clear gamma-ray signal increase in the top of the Heist-op-den-Berg Member. In the Poppel-Rauw Fault area and eastwards of it, occurs a slightly coarser unit, the informal ‘level 1-2 sand’ of the Mol Formation. The top of the latter is indicated by the start of a trend in gamma-ray and resistivity signals whereas in the Retie Member these signals are stable. Although the few grain-size data available in the top of the ‘level 1-2 sand’ suggest a coarser grain size compared to the Retie Member, the gamma ray signal of the ‘level 1-2 sand’ unit is higher (Vandenberghe et al., 2020) requiring  further data.",

For the Retie Member occurring east of Kasterlee, gamma-ray logs are interpreted (ON-Retie-1; ON-Dessel-3; ON-Dessel-4; ON-Mol-2B). An additional reference geophysical expression on the gamma-ray log of the Retie Member together with the informal ‘level 3 clay bed’  above it  and the informal ‘level 1-2 sand ‘ unit below it is the Postel SCK 13 borehole (032W0415 / kb17d32w-B385) between 69 and 92 m depth."

The thickness varies from about 40m in south Belgium to 60m in North Belgium. Calcareous fossils like nummulites and molluscs are present. Glauconite?rich horizons occur. The more heterogeneous composition of the sediment is shown by layering (see e.g. Marke quarry in Steurbaut, 2006 fig. 7), also well visible in the geophysical well logs. Several of these specific layers, labeled 1 to 6 in the log examples in the compendium, can be recognised and correlated between well logs with a reasonable degree of confidence. Based on the correlation of these levels, Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009) have selected a specific level as the boundary level between the Orchies and the Roubaix Member which corresponds approximately to the position of the Steurbaut (1988) definition. On the geophysical logs in the compendium, this level can most easily and reproducibly be picked below the base of the first marked sandy excursion on RES logs (labeled 6 in the compendium) and the corresponding sharp drop in GR.",

Roubaix is a town in North France and was the original reference for this clay type as described by Gosselet (1874) and therefore the name Roubaix Member is retained. In the 1:40 000 mapping the Roubaix Member was mapped in the Yc unit, however in the Kortrijk area it was erroneously mapped as Yd (Steurbaut & Nolf, 1986; Geets et al., 2000).

These comprise on the one hand the superjacent much sandier Eigenbilzen Sand Formation displaying in some outcrops the typical rhythmicity of the Boom Clay and considered as a geometrical and mainly lateral equivalent of part of the Boom Clay. On the other hand in East-Limburg a sandy unit, the Kerniel Sand, splits up the main clay unit in two parts: the overlying clay designated as Boom Clay and the thinner underlying clay unit as the Kleine-Spouwen Clay (Van den Broeck, 1883a,b). Also included in the Rupel Group is the coastal Berg Sand, underlying the Kleine-Spouwen Clay; in some areas the Berg Sand also occurs below the Boom Clay where it is a paleogeographical lateral evolution of the lower part of the Boom Clay. The Kerniel Sand, Kleine-Spouwen Clay and Berg Sand are grouped as members into the Bilzen Formation.\nLithologically and from a sedimentary sequence genetic perspective the lagoonal to shallow marine Ruisbroek Sand unit underlying the Boom Clay in the northwestern part of the occurrence area of the Rupel Group could be included into the Rupel Group (Vandenberghe et al., 2002), but as it occurs in the top of an alternation of lithostratigraphic clay and sand units, originally abbreviated a (argile) and s (sable) and grouped as the Complexe argilo-sableux de Kallo by Gulinck (1969), it has been grouped as a member in the Zelzate Formation of the Tongeren Group (see NCS website). An analogous remark could be made about the Borgloon Formation of the Tongeren Group underlying the Rupel Group in its southern and eastern occurrence area as these deposits make up the initial sediments of the important transgression that will later deposit the Rupel Group sediments (Vandenberghe et al., 2003).",

Note however that in contrast to earlier versions of the stratigraphic inventory, the Voort Sand is no longer included in the present definition of the Rupel Group. This follows from the integration of the mainly Chattian sand and clay units, such as the Voort Sand, into the Veldhoven Formation of Chattian to Aquitanian age (De Nil & Verhaegen, 2022) occurring dominantly in the RVG; hence further including these units in the Rupel Group would expand this group too far outside its core area of occurrence.",

            "age": "The chronostratigraphic scheme presented in Figure 5 is based on the Geological Times Scale 2020 (Speijer et al., 2020). Note that the age for the GSSP Chattian is slightly different (27,82 Ma) in the ICS chart (2023/4). Chronostratigraphic anchoring is based on magnetostratigraphy (Lagrou et al., 2004) and on nannoplankton and dinoflagellate biostratigraphy. The identification of D. biffi in Van Simaeys et al. (2005) has not been withheld (for arguments see 5.1 in Munsterman and Deckers, 2020). The hiatus between Rupelian and Chattian is mainly situated in Rupelian time (see also Coccioni et al., 2018). In addition age intervals within the Rupel Group are based on the obliquity cycles in the ON-Mol-2D borehole (Vandenberghe et al., 2022) starting with the base of Rupel Group at 32 Ma (NP22/NP23 boundary). A silicified foraminifera event is considered the start of the tectonic tilting with uplift and erosion in the west (De Man et al., 2010). The boundary between the Rupel Group and the overlying Veldhoven Formation (line 4) is a low angle unconformity (Dusar and Vandenberghe, 2020 3.2) and in northeast Belgium at this level the RVG graben fault activity resumes depositing much thicker Chattian deposits in the graben. The hiatus between the top of the Rupel Group and the base of the Chattian Voort Sand is dated following De Man et al. (2010) and Coccioni et al. (2018). The age of the basal Voort Sand is put at the start of the Svalbardella interval including the Asterigerina horizon almost at the NP24/NP25 boundary (Coccioni et al., 2018 table 1; Speijer et al., 2020 fig.28.11). Assuming the latter boundary only slightly deviates from the North Sea NP24*/NP25* proxy (De Man et al., 2010), the Voort Sand outlier in the Antwerp area is correlated to this nannoplankton boundary (Vandenberghe et al., 2004).",
            "area_of_occurrence": "The deposits of the Rupel Group occur north of the rivers Durme, Rupel, Dijle, and of the line Leuven-Tongeren. Along the southern rim of this area, the Rupel Group crops out. The deposits dip to the north and are therefore present in the subsurface of the Antwerp Campine and Limburg Campine areas (Figure 1b).",

            "thickness": "The maximal thickness in North Belgium is about 140 m (Weelde SCK 98 borehole) and about 120 m in the Mol-Dessel area (Figure 2). Compared to the North Belgium area the Rupel Group was eroded by about 80 m towards the Antwerp area (De Man et al., 2010). In the outcrop zone along the Rupel river the thickness is even further reduced to about 40 m (Reet borehole ). In the Land van Waas area only the lower part of the Rupel Group is preserved, about 12 m clay is exposed in the former clay pit at Sint-Niklaas (SVK pit). Along the Albert Canal in Southeast Limburg the Rupel Group thickness is about 45 m (Figure 3).",
            "type_locality": "The Rupel Group is slightly dipping to the north-northeast (Figure 1b). It reaches the surface at the south-southwestern rim of its occurrence area, except in the northern Hageland, where channel erosion and channel infill has removed the Rupel Group sediments and replaced it by the Neogene Diest Formation. As a consequence, two main outcrop areas can be considered: a western area comprising the Land van Waas, the Rupel area and the Nete-Dijle interfluvium, and an eastern area comprising the southern Hageland and the Demer area in Limburg (Figure 1a).\nAs reference sections for the Rupel Group in the Antwerp Campine, the cored and geophysically logged boreholes at Weelde (SCK 98) and Mol (SCK-15), together with ON-Mol-1 and ON-Dessel-1, are chosen as representative for the Eigenbilzen and Boom Formations (Figure 2). In the Limburg area the geophysically logged Koewijde-KS2 borehole and the temporary outcrop along the Albert Canal near Eigenbilzen are chosen showing the Bilzen, Boom and Eigenbilzen Formations (Figure 3) (Vandenberghe et al., 2001)."

            "lithological_description": "The Terhagen Member is the part of the Boom Clay in between the Belsele-Waas Member and the Putte Member. If the former member is not present, the Terhagen Member occurs at the base of the Boom Clay Formation above the Bilzen Formation. The Terhagen Member is a banded pale grey clay consisting of a several-dm-scale alternation of silt-enriched and clay-enriched layers (Figure 12). This banded nature is in contrast with the thick silt layers of the underlying Belsele-Waas Member. The pale grey colour is in contrast with the overlying Putte Member which is darker grey to even black stained. The black staining is due to layers with a few percent silt-sized detrital plant particles and such layers in the Terhagen Member are well expressed only at two levels, although under particular conditions a few more very subtle ones can be observed (Figures 13, 14, 15, 16). In the middle of the Terhagen Member occurs a characteristic pinkish to brownish stained silty layer labelled R-horizon (Figures 12, 14, 15, 16). In its part below the R-horizon the clay is calcareous (Figure 15), above the R-horizon carbonate is only occasionally present (Vandenberghe et al., 2014 fig. 11). Septaria horizons S10, S20 (key layer for correlation), S30 and S40 (Figures 12, 13, 14 and photographs 2 & 7 in Vandenberghe (1978)) occur in the Terhagen Member. In the subsurface of the Mol-Dessel area a geophysical continuous carbonate content log has shown a periodicity in the carbonate content all along the complete Boom Clay section, also in the Terhagen Member (Vandenberghe et al., 2022).",

The Waasland clay included the present Belsele-Waas and Terhagen Members. In the section by Vandenberghe (1980) it was indicated as part of the Argile grise.\nThe Terhagen Member of the Boom Clay Formation is included pro parte in the unit labelled R2c on the geological map 1:40 000 (Anonymous, 1892,1896,1900,1909) and pro parte in the unit labelled R2b in the Stratigraphic Register (Anonymous, 1929, 1932).

An almost complete section of the Terhagen Member is given by Vandenberghe (1978, photo 2 p. 25). In the field and on geophysical well logs, the Terhagen Member is fairly easily picked between the top of the silty Belsele-Waas Member (Figures 2 and 15) and the overlying Putte Member (Figures 13, 16). The boundary with the Belsele-Waas Member is identified by the sudden incursion of clay expressed by a low resistivity signal (lowest oblique black arrow 1 on logs in Vandenberghe et al., 2001 figs. 3, 5-7 /Figures 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d, 11). On geophysical GR logs the boundary with the overlying Putte Member is identified by a sudden increase in GR announcing the organic richer Putte Member (Figure 2)."

            "lithological_description": "In the recent literature, based on outcrop observations, the Vlierzele Member is described as consisting of a lower part of mostly bioturbated, slightly clayey, glauconitic sand and an upper section of alternating units of tidal cross?bedding with mud drapes and structureless intercalations; the upper section may contain lignite lumps (Houthuys, 1990). In the recent literature, based on outcrops, the Vlierzele Member is described as consisting of fine glauconitic green?grey mostly bioturbated sand, finely laminated horizontally and in cross stratification. Towards the base the sands becomes clayey and more homogeneous. Towards the top individualised clay layers occur together with humic intercalations. Macrofossils are very rare. Thin cemented siliceous sandstone beds commonly occur (Geets et al., 2000); irregularly shaped siliceous sandstone concretions are also common. The maximal thickness is about 20 m; in the type locality the cross bedded sand above is 7m thick and the lower homogeneous sand at least 5 m (see sections in Houthuys & Gullentops, 1988 p 142). Fobe (1995), after reviewing information available from more than 25 localities, considers the traditional Vlierzele sand sensu stricto as only one of 5 members in a formation between the Pittem Member and the Aalter Sand in the Zenne Group. Steurbaut (2006) reports erroneous correlations in Fobes (op.cit.) subdivisions ; the Beernem sand, traditionally a member of the Aalter Formation of the Zenne Group (Maréchal & Laga,1988 p 120?121; Geets et al., 2000), is included in the Vlierzele unit by Fobe and the existence of a distinct Aalterbrugge unit is refuted by this author. Therefore the present review is not following the interpretations by Fobe (1995, 1997) but recognizes that the clayey basis, a 3?10m very fine clayey sand with mm?thick clay layers, (Lochristi layer sensu Fobe) and locally a thin coarser basal layer (Hijfte layer sensu Fobe) merit a separate mention aside the traditional Vlierzele sand sensu stricto (which according to Fobe 1995,1997 could be named Oosterzele unit).",

It also occurs as outliers in the top zones of the South? Flemish hills. On a regional scale the base of the Vlierzele is erosive into underlying strata (see also Fobe, 1989b, 1995). In northern Flanders the grainsize properties of the Vlierzele Member seem to be more variable (Laga & Vandenberghe, 1990 p 1; Fobe, 1993, 1995). The boundary between the clayey sediment of the Pittem Member and the overlying Vlierzele Sand can mostly be traced with reasonable confidence in the geophysical log correlation profiles by Welkenhuysen and De Ceukelaire (2009). On the legend of the 1:40 000 maps the Vlierzele Member is coded P1d and P1n for the upper clayey facies. In the stratigraphic register (1929, 1932) the Vlierzele Member is included in the Y2 division. The P1n?clay, defined by Rutot (1890) and described as a local top clay in the Vlierzele Sand (Gulinck & Hacqaert, 1954) is believed to correspond in fact to the Merelbeke Clay (Fobe, 1995; Buffel et al., 2009).",

However this stratotype is limited to the Vlierzele sand sensu stricto. Following Fobe (1995), as far as the Vlierzele sensu stricto, the Lochristi and Hijfte layers are concerned, the Ursel borehole (039W0212 x= 87.910, y= 204.260, z= + 29 m TAW) shows the Vlierzele Member between 58 and 69,3 m with the Vlierzele sand sensu stricto between 58?63 m, Lochristi layerbetween 63?66 m and the Hijfte layer between 66?69,3 m."

(2005, fig.10) could be systematically split up in 2 parts based on geophysical logs signals (Vandenberghe et al. 2020 fig. 6), the terms Lower and Upper Waubach Member were used (Louwye & Vandenberghe, 2020, fig. 3); since it became clear that the lower part of Waubach sand and gravel could be identified as the Inden Formation, the name Waubach Member is now reserved for its former upper part, but without the prefix upper.  It is not clear how the upper and lower Waubach terms used  above the Inden Formation in the scheme by  Wong et al. (2007) in the adjacent Dutch RVG (Figure 40 1) correspond to parts of the Waubach Sand as described above. Probably the clay shown at the contact between the two parts on the scheme is related to the clay horizon labelled Ki-k-4 and underlain by a sand unit Ki-z-5 by Dusar et al. (2014) Ki-k-4 and Ki-z-5 are absent in the Belgian part of the RVG . The Waubach Sand Member present in the Belgian RVG is labelled Ki-z-4 by Dusar et al. (2014) (see Figure 39 3 in LIS Kieseloolite Formation).",
